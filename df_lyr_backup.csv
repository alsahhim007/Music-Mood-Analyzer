That shines over me, that shines over me?
And how will I live if you take all the give
That you have for me, that you have for me?

Without so madly
Without so fast
Yet still we
Remain

How will I love if you take all the life
From out of me, right from out of me?
Tell me, how will I live if you take all the give
That you give to me?

We burned so brightly
Love so fast
Yet still we remain

Oh
Oh

'Cause we'll live
And we give
Today

I, yeah
But don't'cha know?
You know, you know, you know

You know, you know, you know

3,TRAUVAQ128F92DC677.h5,Fake Problems,Tabernacle Song,"We've almost got job security,
At least there's a roof over our heads.
There are beds in our rooms,
And warm plates of food
Waiting to be had.

We're not asking 
If they want anything,
But we'll take 
What you can give.
I can honestly say
At this point in my life,
I'm grateful for what I get.

So hey,
Why am I trying to escape,
When everything I need is right here
At home?

I read that every good sermon
It starts with a story
To reel the audience in.
But I've got no life experience,
Just this terrible fear
That I'll captivate anything.
If I really have your attention
I'm desperate for the affection
Of a full capacity room.
As sweat seeps from my pores
I race for the door
And don't want it anymore.

So hey,
Why am I trying to escape,
When everything I need is right here?

But the neighbors just called
You didn't make it that far.
They saw ya picking flowers 
From their yard.
Well hip, hip, hooray
What a wonderful escape.
And the way that I see
I see nothing at all,
I'm blindfolded in the backseat
Of a car.
Just drop me somewhere,
I can't retrace my steps.

Can I come back yet
To the only place
That clears my head?
To my home.

Yes, I learned my lesson,
But I'll always be restless,
I can assure you of that.
Even in the kingdom of heaven
I'll be asking the question,
""What's it like in hell""?"

And as He lay down His life
We offer this sacrifice
That we will live just as He died
Willing to pay the price
Willing to pay the price

How Beautiful the radiant bride
Who waits for her Groom with His light in her eyes
How Beautiful when humble hearts give
The fruit of pure lives so that others may live

But when the nighttime comes, hey-hey
There's this cat down there that makes a bad kinda soup
I come around struttin' my luck in my shoop coupe
Cecil gives me coffee
And he won't never take my coin
I say, "" I got thirty dollars in my pocket!
Whatchoo doin' ? ""

I holler, "" Come on, Cecil, take a dollar!
Come on, Cecil, take a ten!
I've finally geared up into a whole buncha big ones
And you're actin' like I'm down-shiftin' ""

He knows all the under-riders on the boulevard
They got to barefoot cruise when it's forty-weight hard
They look particularly dead-beat
Permanently pale
Cecil picks up his butcher knife
Waves it at the jail
The kid say, "" I ain't got no dough, Joe, I just want some o.j""
I said, "" Don't look at me "" ('Cause he was lookin' my way)
Cecil wink upon him some juice and some green
And the kid walks over and puts the quarter in the pinball machine
And he says, "" Come on, Cec, gimme a dollar
Come on Cecil gimme five
I'm in a half-way house on a one-way street
And I'm a quarter past left alive""

He can talk about your people till your hair turns grey

Sufro por la impaciencia de no saber si tu boca besa,
tiemblo cuando imagino tus manos puestas sobre mis hombros,
quiero bailar contigo, lloro porque es un sueño,
te quiero, te quiero, te quiero, te quiero y quiero seguir soñando.

Qué puede pasar, mujer, si me llegas a querer;
si me llegas a querer me vas a matar, mujer.
Qué puede pasar, mujer, si me llegas a querer;
si me llegas a querer, me vas a matar mujer.

Quiero volver a oírte hablando sola frente a un cristal,
quiero ser el cristal que te escuche hablar cada madrugada,
quiero ser un novato, alguien que nunca ha sido,
te quiero, te quiero, te quiero y quiero oídos en tu cama.
Tengo miedo por el misterio de ser sincero, no sé quién eres,
tengo miedo porque presiento que he sido poco frente a tus ojos,
dime que sí me quieres, dime sólo esa mentira,
te quiero, te quiero, te quiero, te quiero y quiero decir te quiero.

Loves with a passion called hate
And what you give is what you get

If I never ever see you (if I never ever see you)
If I never ever see you (if I never ever see you)
If I never ever see you again

If I never ever see you (see you, see you, see you)
If I never ever see you (see you, see you, see you)
If I never ever see you again

And what you give is what you get
And what you give is what you get
And what you give is what you get
And what you give is what you get"

(But you must Rick) I can't, I can't manage
(But you must Rick) Ah, shit

Hoes ass kiss 'cause I'm like Jason, vision
Releasin' me a basket case from prison - Pissed
Blood feenin', the villain like 'Wassup y'all
Deep down schemin' how to kill 'em
Misleadin' a bit, although proceedin' a hit
I made 'em feel I'd never jeopardise my freedom for shit
Played the empty headed part,
Though the moment they dreaded start, neat
Back of the head and took the credit card
Seen properly decease,
Made it look like an everyday robbery to police
And I's out
Police believed a thief pop for sureity, a jerky
Alert the rest to beef up security
And not to get flashy, although another blast occurred
Another brother deservin' to get massacred
Pleasure in poppin' that flea
Should a heard mister tough guy coppin' mad pleas
Not insane, nor am I biased
Though feels good to watch a motherfucker die before
My fly ass
Ain't nuttin' to blast, fuck it
Then I put some crack vials in the ass pocket and was off
Police said a thug awaited, since I didn't leave no evidence
A drug related incident

I still clock the mil' figures, cock back triggers
Reason why your girlfriends dig us - 'cause I kill niggaz

You are my shining star, my guiding light, my thug fantasy
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my thug fantasy

Well I had it up to here, that's why a brother buckin' trife
And gettin' way with murder, this the motherfucking life
At a jam, nine figure on shelf
While your army a nigger snickering among self - thiefs
Who wanna clock the bread off the next
That's why I'm gonna blow their fucking head off
Maybe the victor get stuck up
Giving these clowns opportunity to fuck up
They knowin' that the kid crew showers, eye cowers
And leaves for 'bout a good two hours
While they're like 'we coulda caught Rick what, for allsort'
That's what the assholes thought
Tough guy mumblin', I thunderin'
Why I had a motherfucking A-K ya wondering
And raise it higher, start giving them the fire
As they scream like high pitch women like Mariah
Blood on the wall like, other brothers ball like they hit
Seein' shots split a motherfuckers skull like lettuce
Run a nigger best bet is for another duck in gage
I'm in a motherfucking rage
Mask 'bout face, Now figure dash
Smash 'bout 10 ta 15 nigger ass out
More enemy dug, deceased, caught
Had not, gave one fuck what police thought (what?)
But first I best provide all brainiacs
With evidence of a suicidal maniac

While I clock the mil' figures, cock back triggers
Reason why your girlfriends dig us - 'cause I kills niggaz"

To pull me out of this misery

Like a hero I've always seen you
Even though I would never say
And through the years
The laughter and the tears
It's you who were strong
In the right and the wrong
A tribute to the world that
Blood is thicker than water

I'm tryin' to say that I love you
I'm tryin' to say that I need you,
Brother

And father, I'm in need of your hand
So I can face the world bravely
And father, do you understand
What it is you mean to me

Like a warrior you always conquered
Every battle you had to face
And through the hard times
When life was a bitter fight
It's you who would give
So unselfish you lived
A tribute to the world that blood
Is thicker than water

I'm tryin' to say that I love you
I'm tryin' to say that I miss you

Everything I do makes her cry oh my
It just breaks my heart in two when I hear her sigh
There is nothing worse than to know she hurts

Call it love
Call it pain
Call it all insane

Love is blind
Love is cruel
Love is fine for fools

But I remind her of some unhappy love
Can't replace the love that she had

Y en el suelo gotas de sangre
Porque un grumo te ha cortado

Dime cómo ves el mundo
Exiliado en cada lavabo,
Contando cada minuto,
Administrándote los gramos
Dime cómo ves mi cara
Desde tus ojos desquiciados.
Dime cómo huele el viento
Desde tu tabique blanco.

He venido a contarte
Que tu novia te ha dejado
Que ya no le funcionas
Que estás acabado
Me ha dicho que cuando te vea
Te dé un abrazo

Creo que soy el único que sigue a tu lado
Anda, tira eso
Subámonos al tejado y cuenta
Cuéntame lo que quieras
Cuéntame que estás enganchado
Y dime cómo ves el mundo exiliado en el lavabo
Exiliado en el lavabo"

There’s no spunk left in me
I feel so hollow in me
So empty, so empty, so empty, so empty
A big chunk of what I was is gone
And left me a desperate man

Now I'm a desperate man
A lonely, scared, sad, sorry man

Now I just wanna get back to me
Oh baby, hoo hoo
Back into the man I used to be

Things that I said I wouldn't do, I did 'em
Secrets below the service of truth I hid 'em
This man kind is past, but can he erase
The tears of a million years is human race
Of animals, that talk and walk upright
Then slave all day and fall in a trance at night
Flowing the planet, trying to find missing links
Like the men we used to be and always suppose to think
Mysteries, maybe not
It's getting hot, we better configure the plot, but
I hold a pen with the grip so tight
That'a squeeze the ink out'ta the page, and write a song for the people
Came up from the underground, now I write above on a hovercraft sound
This microphone, like an an amphetamine
Keeping me clean, speaking in dreams
So nature can intervene, just for a scene

I tried it, I couldn't find it
Now I just wanna get back to me
Oh baby, hoo hoo
Back into the man I used to be

I walk along this path alone, my feet hurt
Lost some friends along the way, I did dirt
I went to church, I tried everything
From leaving my body, to watching the birds sing
For hours, so I could feel heavenly powers
Had been across the universe and inside of flowers
But what is it worth, I'm still just a man on the earth
Rappers are acting like man tan
Can I be candid, I can't stand it
Rap bandit, got heaven acting frantic
I wanna swing my sword decapitate
But what is a man if he acts like an ape
So I sit back, planning my great escape
Load up my EPS and peruse my record crate
The man I used to be, I can only see by looking beyond me
So what is reality, I don't know

I tried it, I couldn't find it
Now I just wanna get back to me
Oh baby, hoo hoo
Back into the man I used to be

Wrong song
You know what
I woke up in the morning
I took a trip to the corner store
That's when I heard my calling
But I'd never heard the voice of truth before
So I kept on walking
Pretended I didn't see
Walked by a window and my reflection said to me
You could try all the same
But you'll never know this mystery
There's no pilot on your plane
So you're not the man you used to be
Try all the game, but you'll never know this mystery
When your pilot has no plane
Said you're the man you used to be seen
Holla and ya holla, you folla you fall
Ya holler and ya holla, you folla you fall
Ya holler and ya holla, you folla you fall
Ya holler and ya holla, you folla you fall
Ya holler and ya holla, you folla you fall
Ya holler and ya holla, you folla you fall
Yo, microphones get ripped holding us back
K dash rocking it out, rocking the cold style
Making it up, go along singing my song
Woke up, in the early morn didn't know what was going on
Whatever, I don't really know
Flows like an immaculate goat what up, whatever"

To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain
I don't necessarily buy any key to the future or happiness
But I need a little place in the sun sometimes or I think I will die

But everywhere is somewhere and nowhere is near
Everybody got somebody with their wine and their beer
So I'm just this tragic figure in the corner over here
With an empty apartment and a best friend who is a queer

Every time I see him he smiles 
And tells me how well he is walking these miles
But he never ever asks a single thing about me
If I die he'd hear about it eventually

Diamonds, roses I need Moses
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain

An everywhere is somewhere and nowhere is near
Everybody got somebody with their wine and their beer
So I'm just this tragic figure in the corner over here

Well here we go again
'Cause I'm your lover, your protector
And your very best friend

There ain't a doubt in my mind
That we were meant to be

Feel my frequency

I want you next to me
For the rest of my life
I'm singin' no more lonely nights
Like Bob Marley

Everything is gonna be all right
Said I want you by my side
Till the day that I die
We can drink get high

We can dance all night
Under the monlight
Tongue and cheek
I got you freakin' on me

Now when the sky is fallin' down
Girl I found that your the cure
'Cause your the only thing that's real
When I'm feelin' insecure

Your always there for me
When I need someone to care for me
Apparently you made the right move
Rather carefully

So till the end I'm lovin' you
Kissin' you and huggin' you

A different point of view

And after everything
That we've been through
It's really easy lovin' you

My heart has got
The scars to prove
I'm obsessed with you
And everything you do

Its magical
It brings me close to you
Close is true
I don't know what you do

And I remember when we started
Everything was so real
And there's no words to express
The way you make me feel

And lovin' you ain't hard
It's easy 'cause your beautiful
And who knows what's comin' next
Our sex is like a ritual

Ooh child
Baby girl you got a place in my heart
You either hold my life together
Or you break it apart

You really got a hold on me
Don't you ever let go
Don't you let me be
Till I tell you so

You on my mind all the time
Your so controlable
'Cause you oh so fine
And I'm claiming you as mine

Whoa-oh hey no
How low will I go
How high can I get
I've lost all control

Whoa-oh hey no
How far will we go
You got a hold on my soul
Don't you ever let go

Make that go away

When I forgave
I wish you would

Just come in
Just leave that right there
Love does not care
Just come in
Lay your heart right here
You should never fear

You think you've crossed
Some sacred line
And now I will ignore you
If you look up
You will find
My heart is still toward you
Look at the sky
The east to the west
That's where I threw this
When you first confessed
Let it go now

I will forgive you
No matter what you've done
No matter how many times
You turn and run
I love you

How much better off she would be
The longer I hold on and the longer this goes on
The harder that it's gonna be
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me
I've never deserved her God knows when I hurt her
That's the last thing that I want to do
She tries but she can't tell how she feels but I know
Too well what she's going through
If I love her so much I don't know why I can't do
The right thing and just let her be
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me

Last night I told her this time it's all over making
Ten times I've told her goodbye
Last night we broke up this morning I woke up
And for the tenth time I'm changing my mind
I saw more love in her eyes when I left her
Than most foolish men will ever see
And it's four in the morning and once more the dawning

do que um cantor de soul
sou eu quem te refresca a memória
quando te esqueces de regar as plantas
e de dependurar as roupas brancas no varal
só faz milagres quem crê que faz milagres
como transformar lágrima em canção
vejo os pombos no asfalto
eles sabem voar alto
mais insistem em catar as migalhas do chão
sei rir mostrando os dentes
e a língua afiada
mais cortante que um velho blues
mas hoje eu só quero chorar
como um poeta do passado
e fumar o meu cigarro
na falta de absinto
eu sinto tanto eu sinto muito
eu nada sinto

I got my blaster set I'm ready to start a minor war.
This won't be the day you were hoping for so just walk away walk away.
Better run now cause your done now cause your standing in a bad man's town, boy.
Time to get back to my daily routine have a beer at a bar on Tattooine.

You take away everything, make my people scream out loud.
Just bring it back
Lord just bring it back.
You mess it up and you rearrange open your eyes and turn the page.
Just bring it back.

I believe I'll interject to talk about the word respect.
It's not a word that's in your hands
Its more about the common man
You took your time and paved the way
Making room for other man to play a
Grip of bodies a mess of minds endless conversations to rock."

Lately I've been stayin' at home

Workin' the crosswords, turn off the phone
(Turn off the phone, turn off the phone)

And I dream I'm on vacation
'Cause I like the way that sounds
It's a perfect occupation
For me
I don't mind being by myself
If there's no one else around
It's the last good time in town

Well, I could stand up straight, get a real job
Stay up late with the same old mob
But it hasn't crossed my mind
Lately

Put on a suit, work downtown
Then come up when the sun goes down
No, I haven't had the time
Lately

Lately I've been stayin' at home
(Stayin' at home, stayin' at home)
Closin' the curtains, play jazz on trombone

No, you won't see me around

On regardait hagards, ils sont fous, on pleurait de chagrin
Alors que des pétards explosaient dans les rues
Leur fête insupportable et puis leurs feux de joie
Nous partions têtes basses digérer notre nuit, 
Vomir notre dégoût

Et déja de partout bien rangés courraient les policiers
Leur petit chef debout au balcon de la honte
Et le peuple à sa botte
Lui remettait les clés, la mémoire est bien courte
Notre France est aux fers
Tous les Denis Robert n'ont qu'à bien se tenir, 
N'ont qu'à bien se tenir

Il pouvait maintenant à sa guise égorger la liberté
La main-mise sur tout, le grand marionnettiste
Des journaux, des télés
En regardant le port s'éloigner dans le noir
J'ai serré fort mon fils, si triste de me voir si triste
Mais dans mes yeux je sais il a bien lu mon coeur

Résistance, résistance, résistance

Tout autour tout ces feux tous ces points de lumière
Ces milliers de bateaux
Je connais ce signal c'est celui de nos frères
Hissons haut le drapeau
Main dans la main nous allons revenir
L'heure n'est plus aux pleurs il faut organiser le venir
Et dans ces heures sombres repense à Charletty,
Repense à la lumière
A tous ces coeurs lancés ce murmure qui gronde,
Ne s'arrêtera plus
Dans ce nouveau maquis ne pas suivre à genoux
Ne jamais se soumettre et toujours résister droit debout,
Droit debout

Résistance, résistance, résistance
Résistance, résistance, résistance

Tu peux pleurer mon fils, oui mais pleurer pleurer de fierté
Nous allons revenir bien plus forts,
Bien plus forts que jamais"

It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one
Thinking about everything we become
And I hate it
I thought we could make it

But I'm ready to dead this
Just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures
And the letters she sent

You had me thinking
You were out with your friends
I'm so foolish
Play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I

Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again

'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why
But this is what you say

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

Visions in my mind
Of the day that we met
You showed me things
That I'll never forget

Took me swimming
In the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating
You think I'm playing

When you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses
And my loving
But ain't nobody better than us

Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again
'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

I guess it's over indefinitely
But you and I know
It's not that easy to let go
Of everything that we planned
And start all over again

Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won't forget how you do it
Sweet baby this is where the game ends now
Somehow wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

You finna make me say boy
I wish that you come hold me
When I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to

You would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(When we ride we ride, it's till the day we die)
Boy you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say
(When we ride we ride, it's till the day we die)

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride

Before you drift to sleep upon your cot
Think back on all the tales that you remember
Of Camelot

Ask ev'ry person if he's heard the story
And tell it strong and clear if he has not
That once there was a fleeting wisp of glory
Called Camelot

Camelot, Camelot
Now say it out with pride and joy
Camelot, Camelot

Yes, Camelot, my boy
Where once it never rained till after sundown
By 8 a.m the morning fog had flown
Don't let it be forgot that once there was a spot
For one brief shining moment that was known
As Camelot"

And you're unaware
And your friends all say that you're looking great
Those black and white movies apply

It's so unfair but so clear
Don't none of them represent me
And ain't one of them represent my peers
And it don't matter who we vote for, nor who gets in
The poor keep dying and the rich keep living
Mothers keep losing their children to the system
They stay strong while we remain victims
Telling us to hope for higher things
Educate yourself ain't that how y'all say it
But they keep increasing the fee
Knowing full well that we can't pay it
And did you stop and listen before you started dishing
Our tax for ammunition to kill innocent children
When right in front of you we can't cope
We hungry, homeless, unemployed and broke
Were dying, the health service is a joke
You said things would change when you wanted our votes

But it stays the same
Mr. Prime Minister
And we continue to die
Mr. Prime Minister
Not a damn thing changed
Mr. Prime Minister
Nobody hears our cries

When my life's a threat
They tell me run go call police
But yet who's gonna protect me from the beasts
They ain't got my interest at heart
They ain't my friends
Ain't got a enemy alive as evil as the system
So much corruption and this gun shit wont end
And all they sit and f***ing do is blame 50 Cent
Please, now take responsibility
Who's putting them runs on our streets
And who's pumping drugs into our community
Controlling the propaganda on my TV
And who's molding our children's ideologies
And taking away their opportunity
Were killing each other so we can live above our means
'Cause what we earn can't even buy a fraction of our dreams
And wonder why so many have become fiends
It's so hard to live poor and keep your hands clean
So I am keeping mind together
And pray that god forgives my sins
Its real hard living the life were living"

'Cause I don't feel that I deserve the sunshine's rays.
The darkness helped until the whiskey wore away,
And it was then I realized that conscience never fades.
When you're young you have this image of your life:
That you'll be scrupulous and one day even make a wife.
And you make boundaries you'd never dream to cross,
And if you happen to you wake completely lost.
But I will fight for you, be sure that
I will fight until we're the special two once again.

And we will only need each other, we'll bleed together,
Our hands will not be taught to hold another's,
'Cause we're the special two.
And we could only see each other, we'll breathe together,
These arms will not be taught to need another's,
'Cause we're the special two.

I remember someone old once said to me:
That lies will lock you up with truth the only key
But I was comfortable and warm inside my shell,
And couldn't see this place could soon become my hell.
So is it better to tell and hurt or lie to save their face?
Well I guess the answer is don't do it in the first place.
I know I'm not deserving of your trust from you right now,
But if by chance you change your mind you know I will not
Let you down 'cause we were the special two, and will be again.

And we will only need each other, we'll bleed together,
Our hands would not be taught to hold another's,
'Cause we're the special two.
And we could only see each other we'll breathe together,
These arms will not be taught to need another's
'Cause we're the special two.

I step outside my mind's eyes for a minute.
And I look over me like a doctor looking for disease,
Or something that could ease the pain.
But nothing cures the hurt you bring on by yourself,
Just remembering, just remembering how we were

And we would only need each other, we'd bleed together,
These hands would not be taught to hold another's,
We were the special two.
And we could only see each other we'd bleed together,
These arms would not be taught to need another's
'Cause we're the special two."

Yeah Yeah
Kamachi, Planetary, King Syze

(Chief Kamachi)
Yo, they love the way I pin a champ,
Under a tinted lamp hear my voice blast from a vintage amp.
I kill the reciters of lies,
Get burned by the fire from the light in my eyes.
It's Kamachi, possessed by the pharaoh ways,
Underground like where the dead bone marrow stays.
The spot where you breath is where the arrow lays,
A sideways death for a narrow grave.
My shit hit hard like an Arab raid.
We blow up, ain't no need for a barricade.
They looking for good luck, like a barrel of jade,
They looking, so stuffed when the barrel is sprayed.
Since the five perfect exertions, they waited afraid.
The devil caught from the tower on the table is slayed, pussy.

Fall back, fold up, rappers is so tough,
Until the army roll up banging that cold crush.
We send shots through ya vest and leave your soul touched,
Lock and load up, post up, toast up.

(King Syze)
Aiyo, my vocal duel, payments hiatus save the local crews.
Only the chosen few can ride with the most explosive crew.
But not you, jealous ones they envy us,
'Cause we spit venomous, until books remember us.
Hell fire embedded in us, plus sins condemning us,
It's just what I write, ignite cop killers and predators.
I be like this, best believe I can't be ignored,
Spitting metaphoric, until the chosen child is aborted.
When my mind's in orbit, forces knock you out your high horses.
Deal with high sources, until the meal is five courses.
The flames is high, when my brain and the train collide.
Under much needed change in time, the game is mine.
Build strength through the niggas that be hating me peers,
But it's the army, part of me y'all been waiting for years.
From a small block, hip hop, busting my tool.
King Syze, dope shit, what can I say man? It's nothing new.

Fall back, fold up, rappers are so tough,
Until the army roll up banging that cold crush.
We send shots through ya vest and leave your soul touched,
Lock and load up, post up, toast up.

(Planetary)
I'm a scientist in the lab, with a violent twist and a gift of gab,
Pharaoh tongue that can lash through your clique and stab.
From the days where you carried screw drivers,
In back pockets in case you had to prove that your crew lava.
We was painting on your property,
And until this day I still got rookie niggas out trying to copy me.
Planetary nigga, Q-D original,
Smooth criminal, bash your mental, bruise your physical.
There's something about the evilness of this track,
It makes the heaven's gates close, and the tabernacles crack.
In fact, it separates all the lies and the facts,
It makes you see the light right before the sky turns black.
It turns boys to men, it turns toy soldiers to generals,
Innocent mother fuckers graduate to criminals.
It makes you think twice about who you are,
It makes you feel like death's coming every 16 bars.


Fall back, fold up, rappers is so tough,
Until the army roll up banging that cold crush.
We send shots through ya vest and leave your soul touched,
Lock and load up, post up, toast up."

To fading memory

As summer gave it's life away to autumn
A promise made fulfilled on his return
A six month job with a privateer
Knowing it'll make him rich to give
All that she deserves

The farmers warned of nasty weather
The worst in many years
The winter took away her love and now
She's alone with her tears

The winter slowly passed away to spring
She spends her days out waiting on the pier
Spring turned into summer
And she realized he wasn't coming home
On a warm summer's day she went alone
Blinded by her grief she said goodbye to the sun
Up upon the widow's walk they saw her fall into the bay
A fading memory

The farmers warned of nasty weather
The worst in many years
The winter took away her love 
But now there's no more tears
She brought herself back to his arms
Within a watery grave
And now they spend eternity together
Lost within the waves"

Given every samurai a twirl
An HIV V.I.P.
Backseat panties down around her knees

She's got no money
Can't pay the rent
It's a sunny day now baby
Every night on her back that's spent
Honey, it's how ya makin' money

This is a world destruction, your life ain't nothing
The human race is becoming a disgrace
Countries are fighting in chemical warfare
Not giving a damn about the people who live
Nostradamus predicts the coming of the Antichrist
Hey, look out, the third world nations are on the rise
The Democratic Communist Relationship
Won't stand in the way of the Islamic force
The CIA is looking for defectors
The KGB is smarter than you think
Brainwash mentalities to control the system
Using TV and movies, religions of course
Yes, the world is headed for destruction
Is it a nuclear war
What are you asking for

This is a world destruction, your life ain't nothing
The human race is becoming a disgrace
The rich get richer, the poor are getting poorer
Fascist, chauvinistic government fools
People, Moslems, Christians and Hindus
Are in a time zone just searching for the truth
Who are you to think you're a superior race
Facing forth your everlasting doom
We are Time Zone, we've come to drop a bomb on you
World destruction, kaboom, kaboom, kaboom

(I don't clear my mind)
(Well, that makes two of us)
(I can't clear my mind)

This is the world destruction, your life ain't nothing
The human race is becoming a disgrace
Nationalities are fighting with each other
Why is this, because the system tells you
Putting the people in racist categories
Knowledge isn't what it used to be
Military tactics to control a nation
Who wants to be a president or a king (me)
Mother Nature is gonna work against you
Nothing in your power that you can do
Yes, the world is headed for destruction
You and I know it, the Bible tells you
If we don't start to look for a better life
The world will be destroyed in the Time Zone

All right I might
Have had a little glare when I stared at ya ho
But I didn't know she was like that
She stared right back
My niggas warnin me that she was comin' on to me
I react like a mack do I act cool
Just to test her 'cause I ain't no jester
I suggest her and her friend be outtie
'Cause I don't want to make my pals get rowdy
And doubt me our friendship
But when lips touch
I go crazy in the clutch
Sorta like schitzo I forgets my bros and pals over gals
I didn't mean to but when you fiend you do
Strange things for the denim no matter who's in em
Grab a flooze then I'm in traffic
Don't laugh it might be your girl that I'm talkin' about
I didn't mean to

Chorus: Repeat 2X

It ain't my fault that your girl got caught
It ain't my fault that your girl got caught (I didn't mean to)

Verse Two:

Another incident when I went
Way beyond what I should have done
John should of stopped before them drawers dropped
But I didn't ain't no quittin
Really didn't care who's girl I was hittin
I admit skinz ain't a reason to lose friends
But then again I didn't know, sorry
Accept apologies and live on
Are we goin' hold grudges well oh fudge
It's a new year and I do fear
Ya actions ya actin' shy
I mean ya need to be smackin
That hoe
Instead of tryin' to front on me ya know
That's exactly how I'm goin' to be ya know
I run my game on any G ya know
'Cause we the most entertainin
I meant to blame women
For makin' me do what the Ak seem to
When you call I screen you
I didn't mean to


Verse Three:

Why do fools be schememin dreamin'
Actin' like demons
Niggas don't give a fuck
Because they beat shit
To many girls front cute
When they want loot
They tell lies the swell guys
Can peep it and that's weak shit
That's why I run game on every freak I get
Born in Oakland grew up pumpin Too Short
I know the rules on the flooze so who's short
I once had a ho who smoked blunts yo
She tried to get me so I looked at the front door
And now she's not with me so forget it
But every once in a while I'll hit it
And it happened to be your girl
I didn't mean to and I been through
Your relationship and I hate dumb dips
But I really can't trip when they ride my tip

Go find your fortune fast, its cold outside but you'll make it
Don't trade your love for ambition, or you'll get washed away

Do the best you can, it'll all work out at the end of the storm you get to love another day

Well you can bring the drinks a little mo' my way

Just touched down, called up my 8-1-8
Fo' a date with some other bust downs
And I cruised up the block, car losed up the top
I take the breeze, quick break the trees
Feel good as we flippin through the Robb Repo't
My baby momma ain't trippin' on child suppo't

Well my baby momma is, because she see havin' kids
As a tool for gettin' chips, that's with or without the dip
She told my lawyer she's a nurse but she can't spell school
Quite frankly she's a motherfuckin fool, idiot
Welcome to the city where you might see thangs
Like real threats, fake breasts, negativity hangs
Over the city like a puppet string, pullin you up
You think they love you till the director yells cut
Now they packin you with ice and zippin you up

It's on tonight, get licked, get gone tonight

Rememberin the days on the block sippin whiskey
Runnin' 'round grinnin, runnin' 'round sinnin
Gettin' lit, then I wonder why my head kept spinnin

And tonight we gon' celebrate bein alive, riiiiight

Can't nothin' go wrong cause my strap's on my back
And if fools wanna scrap then my tool will attack
But forget the click-clack, ain't no need for the steel
Just a straight house party and some meat on the grill

And you - you keep on waiting
For something better - better off to come around

You - well you wanted more time
So I gave you more time
Oh but I am the sun that waits to come around

Oh but you were a restless soul

Reads war torn country still a mess

You're wrong to me and now I see
I'm not that bitch you want me to be

It's not too late, to turn the hate
Into a chance to get into my way
You can waste your breath
But you're my past
It's certain that I leave

Now I start to wipe the slate clean
'Cause I got my own head, got my own feet
I'm not worry about anything
It's time to make my deal

Now I'm going my own way
I can go for much better days
Than with you my dear
Now I'm back in my life again
I begin to forget the end it's me now and here

I got some dimes
Don't need a crime
I got a goal fixed on my mind
A new best friend, who understands
The way I'm talking, the way I am

I don't feel the pain
It's not the same
Like anytime you gave me blame
It's my turn to play
My own game
Man I'm feeling free

Now I'm going my own way
I can go for much better days
Than with you my dear
So now I'm back in my life again
I begin to forget the end it's me now and here

I don't know why it took me so long...
So many reasons that you gave me
To walk off with bad memories
So now it's easy, it's easy,
It's easy, it's easy...

Now I'm going my own way
I can go for much better days
Than with you my dear
So now I'm back in my life again

Survived without you
Bringing out the kid in me
Now I'm resigned to say

Only you

You and only you
Can take this heart
And make it new

To make something of my day
But I hopelessly drift away
To the place where
We can be alone again

You better get rid of that nine, it ain't gonna help
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?

I'm waiting for hell like hell shit I'm anxious as Hell
Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen I was putting shells in a gauge on a shelf

I used to get punked and bullied on my block
Till I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox
{""Mom! MOM!""} I used to give a - fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of success?  It sucks, too much press I'm stressed

Too much cess and breasts, too upset
It's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick (yes)
Grew up quick (no) was raised right
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say is right

You think of my name now whenever you say, ""Hi""
Became a commodity because I'm W-H-I-T-E 
'Cause MTV was so friendly to me can't wait 'til Kim sees me

just to see if he's influenced by me if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit he's an innocent victim
and becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe

{*vocal scratches*} My name is Slim Shady
I been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational {""Back is the incredible!""}
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff on the internet
Trying to lure your kids with him into bed

It's a sick world we live in these days
""Slim for Pete's sakes put down Christopher Reeve's legs!""
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
""Slim it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it""

Mind with no sense in it, fried to get schizophrenic
whose eyes get so squinted, I'm blind from smoking 'em
With my windows tinted, with nine limos rented
Doing lines of coke in 'em with a bunch of guys hopping out
all high and indo scented {*inhales, exhales*}

Add an AK-47, a revolver, a nine
A Mack-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
and that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time

Cause (I'mmmm) Shady, they call me as crazy
as the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way, *NSYNC, why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?

Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think?
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
Cause all these fans screaming is making my ears ring (AHHHH!!!)

So I just, throw up a middle finger and let it linger
longer than the rumor that I was sticking it to Christina
'Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez and Puffy you know this!

I'm sorry Puff, but I don't give a fuck if this chick was my own mother
I still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her
And have a son and a new brother at the same time
And just say that it ain't mine, what's my name?

As day dragged into day
The doctors gave no hope for her
She seemed to fade away

My hours were filled with constant dread
Time became a knife
Slowly and relentlessly
Cut the cord of life

There was a Teacher in the region then
Some of us had heard
He'd healed the paralytic
By the power of just His word

So if the hope became rekindled
I went at once to see
If I could find a man named Jesus
From a town called Galilee

I began to search the city
And soon I saw the crowd
They were pressing in to touch Him
And they called His name out loud

But with the strength of desperation
I pushed them all aside
I threw myself before Him
And from my knees I cried

Lord, come and heal my daughter
Even now she's close to death
Her fever's uncontrolable
She fights for every breath

But God's given you the power
Life is yours to give
If You'll just lay Your hands on her
I know that she will live, she will live, she will live

Well, He just began to walk with me
When a face I saw with fear
Came towards me with the news
I knew I didn't wanna hear

And although I tried still myself
I trembled when he said
Don't bother the teacher anymore
Your little girl is dead

And then Jesus touched my shoulder
And told me not to grieve
The trembling stopped when He looked at me
And said only believe

And then He sent the crowds away
Except His closest men
And they followed right behind us
As we started off again

We were still a long ways down the road
When I heard the sounds and cries
Of the mourners and musicians
As they strove to dramatize

My grief, they had no business with
Beneath their loud disguise
My wife just sat there silently
And stared through empty eyes

Then Jesus asked the mourners
Why is it that you weep?
She isn't dead as you suppose
The child is just asleep

It only took a moment
For their wails to turn to jeers
Who does this Man think He is?
Get Him outta here

With authority I've never heard
In the lips of any man
He spoke and every sound rolled out
With a thunder of command

And in the sudden silence
They all hurried for the door
Wondering what the reasons were
They'd ever come there for

Then He called His three disciples
That were with Him on the way
He led them and my wife and me
To where our daughter lay

He took her by the hand
He told her, child arise
And the words were barely spoken
When she opened up her eyes

She rose and walked across the room
And stood there at our sides
My wife knelt down and held her close
And at last she really cried

Then Jesus told us both to see
Our daughter had some food
And as to how her life was saved
Not to speak a word, not to speak a word

I got to tell somebody
I got to tell somebody
I got to tell somebody
I got to tell somebody
I got to tell somebody
I got to tell somebody, got to tell somebody
What Jesus did for me

I got to tell somebody
Got to tell somebody
What Jesus did for me
I got to tell somebdoy
Got to tell somebdoy
What Jesus did for me
I got to tell somebody
Got to tell somebody

I got to tell somebody
I got to tell somebody
What Jesus did, What Jesus did for me
I got to tell somebody
I got to tell somebody
I got to tell somebody
What Jesus did, What Jesus did for me

Ya know He gave me life
When my hope was dead
When there was grief
He brought joy instead

Got to tell somebody

I got to tell somebody
Got to tell somebody
I got to tell somebody

They played covers every Friday night
Bonnie was a waitress and a big fan
And every break the three of them would
Take a drink and talk about life
When it came to love, money or fame
Charley's philosophy was always the same.

It ain't how good you are
It's how bad you want it
It ain't how good you are
It's how bad you want it.

Well, Charley loaded his old Impala
T.J. said, ""I think I'm gonna stay
When you hit it big there, give us a holler.""
And as the dust settled back down
Bonnie turned and asked T.J.
""Why don't you go, you're good enough to try?""
T.J. said, ""Bonnie, Charley was right.""

And when his silver bus came rollin' through
Well, Bonnie made 'em all a fried chicken dinner
And when she left to get them pie

How did she end up with you instead?""

Then she took off like a bright idea 
She believed there just had to be 
A movie that she'd never seen 

I watched as her fingers drew 
A perfect line in space 
I watched as she looked on through 
Into another place 

She found out what she'd been missing 
She decided she could change her luck 
She was right life's not black and white 
It's something more than meets the eye

Hey darlin' pass another Kerr jar to me
Butter drippin' off a biscuit, baby better take a bite
Cantaloupe thumps like it's finally ripe
Box fan on a lawn chair suckin' in swamp air
That's what country is

It ain't a rebel flag you bought at the mall
It's a hide away bed in an old horse stall
Two kids gettin' caught stealin' a Boone's farm kiss
It ain't a John Deere cap that's never fell in the cotton
It's a Jimmy Rodgers song that was long forgotten
It's homemade peach ice cream on sunburnt lips
That's what country is

When the sun starts slippin' from the delta sky
And the last scarecrow tucks in for the night
Make a fire throw a blanket on the sandy bank
'Bout an hour till we feel the first catfish yank
Barefoot cane pole wavin' at the riverboats
They when they're gone take a dip in the moon glow
That's what country is

It ain't a jacked up truck that's never seen a pasture
It's cars pulling over for a no cab tractor
It's homemade peach ice cream on sunburnt lips
No, it can't be bought it's somethin' you're born with"

Up up up and away
And I'm on
A higher plane
With a brain
With a flame
Feel the fire
Desire the same
Knowledge and wisdom
And understanding
Possessed by gods
Transferred to man in
A script of a book
A scripture that looks
Like a Biblical writing
Inviting a hook
Of a song sing along with a strong
Subliminal
Message divesting all men from
Criminal
Acts of the Devil
Revealed and reveled
Designed to recline the mind to lower level
With no spiritual level
Read the Holy Koran
Or the Bible
Because it's liable
To be a revival
For the weak who seek power it'll bring
Infallible power
Knowledge is king
Knowledge
Who wants some
Come get it
A battle is a test of wits
And I'm witted
Hard beats a torch
And I lit it
Stop the music
All right hit it
Now that it feels good
I'm heating up
I feed off knowledge
And can't get enough
Knowledge is infinite
Suckers ain't into it
Ignorance is bliss
And they're kin to it
Party and dance
And don't ever glance
At a book or look
For their mind to advance
Caught in a rut
Chasing butt
Trying to get a dollar
Or trying to get a nut
Evil feeds
Off a source of apathy
Weak in the mind
And of course you have to be
Less than a man
More like a thing
No knowledge you're nothin'
Knowledge is king
Knowledge
My rhymes make
A meak mind anorexic
You can't hang without slang
So eject it
I've selected
Rhymes for records
To affect the effect
Of the rhyme that left
Hangin' like a pound
That came down
But you're hangin' the brain
So your brain's hell-bound
Lost and found
By the serpent's sound
What you don't know
Can't hurt that's profound
Or absurd
A better word
An ingnorant fool
Is a real cool nerd
Pockets are fat
With an empty head
Got a little fame and a name
And you're brain dead
You count dollars
So ya think ya in
What good is knowing how to count
If you don't know when
And history today
And it will equal the future
Repetitive mistakes
Cause the brain ain't acute ya
Need knowledge
To understand
The concept of sacrifice
But man don't understand
So we have to fight
War
Killing people we never
Saw before
Most don't eden know
What they're killin' for
Following rulers
Instead of the prophets
The wicked can rule ya
But the knowledge can stop it
Souls can't be controlled
It's a spiritual thing
But you got the knowledge
Knowledge is king
Knowledge
My knowledge comes
From a spiritual force
Stonger than any
Earthly source
Propaganda
Hype or slander
I won't believe the hype
I understand the
Media dictates
The mind and rotates
The way you think
And syncopates slow pace
Brains
Can't maintain
Acertain
Insipid inane crass rain
Insane lame
Traditions
All praise fame
Positions
Want to be a star
Drive a big car
Live bourgeios
Ane won't know who you are
Lost in the source
And praising the dollar
Whether your faith is
Christ or Allah
The knowledge of God
Will teach one thing
The dollar is moot
Knowledge is king"

Where seldom is heard

From the white trash
Who killed as they came
Though these words dig deep
They offer no relief

I am an Indian chief
There is a secret I keep
It's called the talking leaf
And you better believe
That he speaks his beliefs
Like a rock that bleeds
A sea of grief
My talking leaf speaks of
A wounded knee creek

American ghost dance...

A new man who is with old ways
He walks the streets of life
But he's in chains
I'm alive he cried
I can feel the flame
Burning red inside
I am an Indian brave
There is a memory
That lives in my blood
Of the brand you laid
On all you touched
But the burning flame
Turns to burning pain

And that's truly insane
So like a wild hurricane
I will dance on the grave
Of my race that died
When it should have been saved

I read him Romans 8:14 and this is what he said

""Girl, some of my homeboys told me 'bout a freaky party
Down on 63rd and Babylon
Come on girl, let's go, I got plenty of blow
And it's more fun doing wrong""

""The ladies call me lover 'cause I got the gift of gab
And a few other specialties
I'd really like to make you, if you'd only let me date you
You'd belong only to me""

He said, ""I know that there's a freak deep down inside of you
Dying to get out and ooh""

I don't want to help Youngblood get to the freaky party

I can't begin to tell you of the sadness in my mind

Una vejez sin temores
Y una vida reposada
Ventanas muy agitadas
Y una cama tan inmóvil

Y un montón de diarios apilados
Y una flor cuidando mi pasado
Y un rumor de voces que me gritan
Y un millón de manos que me aplauden
Y el fantasma tuyo, sobre todo
Cuando ya me empiece a quedar solo"
431,TRABBOP128F931B50D.h5,Tom Petty,A Higher Place (Album Version),"We gotta get to a higher place
And we gotta leave by night
Before that river takes us down
We gotta find somewhere that's dry
We gotta run like we've never run,
Or we're gonna lose the light.
If we don't get to a higher place and
Find somebody who can help somebody,
Might be nobody no more

Well, I fool myself and I don't know why
I thought we could ride this out
I was up all night making up my mind
But now I got my doubts
I got my eye on the waterline
Trying to keep my sense of humor
But if we don't get to a higher place and
Find somebody who can help somebody,
Might be nobody no more

We gotta get to a higher place
And I hope we all arrive together
We gotta get to a higher place
If we wanna survive the weather

I remember walking with her in town,
Her hair was in the wind
I gave her my best kiss
She gave it back again
When I add up what I've left behind
I don't want to lose no more
But if we don't get to a higher place and
Find somebody who can help somebody,
Might be nobody no more"

In alleys void of any light where nameless things live out of sight
Down through the scrapers of the sky past neon words glowing all night
Echoes my name between each car, ""Are you happy where you are?""

What's mine was always yours, and yours is mine

Let's go!

And so we carry on each day as if our lives are not so grey
While every breath that we take, we only suffocate
Brush past a myriad of scenes a homeless vet crashed
On Wall Street, a single mom of three, a TV personality

You didn't know who would have control

Where it took seconds to shape fortunes
Your pains it weighed down hell
Spilling blood to cleanse the memories
That you know made you so frail

Empty eyes look through the barrel, sweating fingers on the gun
One push off the threshold to target sympathies
Just a broken statue and the world remains unchanged
So close and still no place where anything would end

Trapped between blooded walls
And the fight was there today
Fists breaking against the concrete
None to forgive no strength to run

How could it be how would it end?
When you wake up you wish them to cry
Fragments of this being fragments of its meaning to burn away

Suffocating in the grasp of this hate
Driven to fire your last round
Escape from the air and drown under the earth
Dead mirror by the wayside, nowhere to turn

An empty shell buried to the ground
Prepare yourself to forfait
Another saviour just another failure
Where bleak winds grind the surface

Fear and regret stain dim recollections
An act of rash solutions
Last one there, the broken statue
Built with hands that are bleeding

Empty eyes look through the shattered image
And their pain it weighs down hell
Spilling blood to cleanse the memories
That you know make you so frail

How could it be how would it end?
When you wake up they are holding your time

Ah, ho-ooh-oh-ooh

Fearless people,
Careless needle.
Harsh words spoken,
And lives are broken.

Forceful ageing,
Help me I'm fading.
Heaven's waiting,
It's time to move on.

Crossing that bridge,
With lessons I've learned.
Playing with fire,
And not getting burned.
I may not know what you're going through.
But time is the space,
Between me and you.
Life carries on... it goes on.

Just say die,
And that would be pessimistic.
In your mind,
We can walk across the water.
Please don't cry,
It's just a prayer for the dying.
I just don't know what's got into me.

Been crossin' that bridge,
With lessons I've learned.
...Learned...

Playing with fire,
And not getting burned.
...Burned burned...

I may not know what you're going through,
But time is the space,
Between me and you.

There is a light through that window
...Light through that window...
Hold on say yes, while people say no

Life carries on
...On on on...
Oh!
It goes on... oh-ee-oh, whoa-ee-oh ho oh...

I'm crossing that bridge,
With lessons I've learned...
I'm playing with fire,
And not getting burned...
I may not know what you're going through.
But time is the space,
Between me and you.
There is a light through that window.
Hold on say yes, while people say no

'Cause life carries on... oh-ee-oh, whoa-ee-oh ho on...
It goes on... oh-ee-on,
It goes on.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Life carries on.

When nothing else matters.

When nothing else matters.

I just don't know what's got into me.

It's just a prayer for the dying.

Es el frío, es el calor, es la tibieza
Es descubrir en una calle desierta
Que es lo mismo ir
Que estar de vuelta

Who will remember all of the things, the things we have forgotten? Who will right the things, the things that we've done wrong? Who will the hearts of those who hurt? Who will be His hands? Who will go?

These are the days we thought would last forever. These are the days thought would never, ever end.

Gonna sit right here until I clear my head,

But I love you now, just like I loved you then,

Bells to tell the king the news
A thousand misty riders
Climb up higher once upon a time

Wondering and dreaming
The words had different meaning

And fairy stories held me high

Passing cheap hotels toward home to get dreaming
The city sky is starless on foot because I'm carless
But the thirty block walk from the spot is not the farthest

That I've gone I move on kept company by neon
Lights 3 a.m. tonight the air is like freon
Fifty in my pocket not much but I can't knock it
Getting paid to light the mic up like a bulb in a socket

Flip the switch tonight I saw it in their eyes
The Fingers kept it live the energy never died
It wouldn't be denied 214 Burnside
We kept their heads moving even kids outside

You can see them on the street through the stage door gate
Ten o'clock even when it gets late
Pass the mic at the end of the night to Dave Queen
Then come back on Tuesday check out Sid the Tennesseans Tony

Green and Stella yeah I remember Tuesdays
No bad things now bring me back to hear the new play
I'll stay late with D.J. Sass until the next day
Fuck Key Largo take me back to the X-Ray

Take me back to the X-Ray

My fingers are frozen my coat is soaked through
My toes are past numb we've got a hundred more to do
They're only getting wetter got to get another up
Luke loads the stapler then he slaps the hammer shut

Tack tack tack down the right then the left side
If you see Five-O then you'd better step hide
Wait until they pass and come around the block again
Time to go back to work before this late night ends

Over on my left he's holding up another poster
Pushing up the corner as the staple falls close to
His index finger as his breath lingers in the air
Water trickles up his arm he doesn't seem to care

He doesn't wear gloves they make it hard to grab the paper
On a late night caper with a state of the art stapler
Damn it's getting cold but still we've got to pass the word
Plastering the poles from Hawthorne to twenty third

But not in front of Fred's or Crocodile they'll tear them down
And never cover the X-Ray's 'cause they support the sound
Luke will tack it back if it belongs to a friend
But if you cover his you'll never see your shit again so watch your

Posters...

Here we go again after the show again I've got to hit the
Streets work my feet and get my flow again
All alone and then I feel the pavement on my aching feet
Dawn will come before this trip's complete

Concrete and light rain stain the city I was born in
I hardly feel alive as the horizon whispers morning
Walking on train tracks from halls where the name's at
I wanted to clear my head but once again all of the pain's back

I'm torn between the place I'm in and where I want to be
Faith won't wait kid so what's it gonna be
Forget it and let it go take no as the answer
Or if you choose to do it better get serious as cancer

But see I took a peek and looked deep into it
And after what I saw I'm not so sure I should pursue it
Still I know a half-step is likely to be my last step
And playing live beats nine to fives so thrive or hit the casket"

Apparently, he went _Kamikaze_. The big question is,
Will the rapper survive?\""

Now it was a war it was like I was in Vietnam
But I kill 'em all, cause _Kamikaze_ was the bomb
Got a strap to my back and I ran in if I was a terrorist
Got 'em all scanned at this President's head everybody be calm
Die for my belief, but got out the rubbish because it
This cup of death, Death was not yet meant for me to drink from it
Thinkin' how could I ever survive, I knew I was ready to ride
I even had C4 duct taped to my stomach but uh
(You got a right to survive)
But you gotta have will and always be ready to come off the wall
They gon' be willin' to test you and catch you if you talk the talk
But I'ma keep on with the struggle fuck leavin' my body in chalk

It's not a given to work 'cause I'm choppin them O's
Can't fuck with the swagger the haters just look at me nigh
I'm stickin them daggers in haters just look at them cry
The shit don't affact us effect us they wanna imagine
They take us lay 'em on the back, I'm makin' 'em look at the sky
If I think they cool, I give 'em a dutch
If they break the rules, I give 'em a crutch
If they on the come up and I feel 'em I give 'em some dust
If they talkin' shit I'ma bust at 'em and get 'em to hush
Get away clean, go high on the meter, I got the streetsweeper
A creeper believe I get deep as the word of a preacher (and I)
Lyrical retriever but good with them heaters
When I'm full of passion and fury like when you listen to Syleena (and I)
Went multi-platinum when I stepped on enemy grounds
Now bodies all over the world is fin' to be found

But protect what's yours, protect your family, protect what's right
Ya Dig!

The story starts off, lil boy black in the ghetto
No matter what he does it's back to the ghetto (ghetto)
No choice but to adapt to the ghetto
So he adapts the ghetto
Yes, the crack and the metal
He took no days off, for gettin' this cocaine off
He ran back and forth so much it pissed Jose off
Now Jose was the cocaine boss
Straight from Columbia, his cocaine soft
But Jose was out fuckin' his sister
Hittin shorty off 'cause he had love for his sister
And shorty had no love for his sister 'cause sister would sniff up everything Jose gives her
But shorty had a plan for them both
'Cause he was good at handlin coke so Jose liked 'em Problem was, he was pitchin for the dudes down the street
You know, Cj, Big Boo, and Meleke
Meleke was a killa, Boo was a killa
Cj, well he's just anotha nigga
Despite the fact, they didn't like the fact, that he was close to Jose and he might just rat
And bein that he was a bitch and he ain't know when its here
They set it up to get him there 'n' hit him there
But shorty was smart, so before they got to load up 'n' spark he said hold up my heart
Please, then he said Please, look up in my bag, there's cook up in my bag
It's all good up in my bag
And there's more where that came from
It came from Jose, believe me there's more where that caine from
He had 'em lost and the game won 
They let him go thinkin' he would let 'em know where Jose was keepin' the heavy coke
But instead he told Jose bout that
And we all know Jose bout that
Next thing we know we see Jose slouch back
In the chair like it's no way out that
He said shoot 'em ima blow they house back
Next day Jose sent the 2-way out town
And somebody blew they house down
Jose think shorty on his side
But he don't know shorty on his side
So shorty called Jose, like listen, it's going down I need more cocaine
So they met up, it was a set up
Guess who? Cj, Meleke and Boo speed up
You shoulda seen the look on Jose's face
You neva seen a look on no man's face
Told him no man's great, and it's no man's place
To fuck with no man's fam
Then he said where's my sister before I kill you
The End

The story's over man (over man)
They all kinda end like that man, ya dig
You see, I told this story because I kinda feel like, every hood, everybody, everybody gotta lil boy fresh and them somewhere
Weither it's right next door, across the hall
Up the block, down the block, around the corner
I mean, you see, you see we all see the same shit, just through diffent eyes
You surprised? Don't be man, It's just real shit
Holla at ya boy dipset, AYE!"

She's the kind that you can't find ramblin' through the land
I'm on my way this very day to win her heart and hand

Shit now I lay me down to sleep
Please god let it end once again let me live life

(Joyo Verlade)
We have a deep passion
We can't keep dwelling on problems

'Cause I can't do another long dance with a ghost
See my head wanna come around half past midnight

(Joyo Verlade)
We have a deep passion
We can't keep dwelling on problems

This situation's gotten out of control (hey he hey)
With all this stress and confrontation I just might overload (hey he hey)
My problems follow me to sleep at night won't let me go (hey he hey)
The more I hide the more they thrive deep down inside of my soul (hey he hey)

(Joyo Verlade)
We have a deep passion
We can't keep dwelling on problems
These bad dreams"

So what is it you're not telling me?
Oh yeah, this time around, I'm not asking.
And oh, how small this town gets when you start asking for too many names.
So where you've come from and where you're going,
I don't care and I'm not asking.

The lord's name will be proclaimed amongst the Nations
We don't have no time for patience

Heavens rejoice and the earth will exalt
Oh no, come swing back like a catapult
The sea and its fullness will roar
He is our help and our shield our soul yearns for the lord
Burning God of Yaacov everlasting stronghold
Break down the door I can't hold back no more
Wait all night long, until the early morning
Like night watchmen wait for the dawning

Arise, be our help
Place my trust in your kindness
It's a must hoping in the God of deliverance
Since way back when before time began
Existing eternally, everlasting, rejoice in the name of his majesty so we sing

Chant sweet melodies, utter hymns and sing praise to his name
For he's alone exalted holy,
Performing mighty deeds and making new things,
Sowing righteousness and creating healing
He spoke, the world came into being
Master of praise, renews each day
Redeems and saves, continuously, blessed is his name
Making great lights, creating luminaries
Abounding in mercy
Won't you grant me?

A love is harder than rocks an' ice
Sometimes love can be so nice
A gamble, just like throwin' the dice
Lose once and then lose twice

But still I'm hoping inside
Jump off then my bend of wide
Somewhere, don't get anywhere
Just get me the hell out of here

Pain you brought in my heart
Ask myself why did I start
This thing, that keeps me daily changing
And driving me crazy

Sometimes I want to step back
But it's still damn hard to do that
No matter what you do
All I want is you

(All I want is you, babe
No matter where you're going to, babe
No matter what you let me know
I'll always follow you)

I'll get to you when you're waving
No matter if you tell me no
I always make it so)

I know what I want
All I want is you, babe)

(I know what I want
I know what I want
All I want is you, babe)

Time is what we're wasting
And success the dreams we're chasing
'Cause we need to sit down, stop for a play around
Find a place to a homelier headtown

Get my brainstorm, bring your things on
Practice love is the idea of born
Peace is what you say to me
All the time you try betraying me

Hope one day you'll stop and we'll see
Yo, that's not the way be
Living a life of blaster won't last her
Look at the world, a disaster

Ever put your hands together
Try to live together, we can never
But still no matter what you do
All I want is you

(All I want is you, babe
No matter where you're going to, babe
No matter what you let me know
I'll always follow you)

It's never my luck so never mind
I wanna say your name
But the pain starts again
It's never my luck so never mind

I had a dream that you were with me
It wasn't my fault
You rolled me over, flipped me over
Like a somersault.
That doesn't happen to me
I've never been here before
But I saw forever in my never
And I stood outside her heaven

Will you wait for me in time?
It's never my luck so never mind
I've lost a lot of what I don't expect to ever return
I tend to push them till the pushing's turned from hurt into burn
I always take them to that place they thought they wanted to go
Then end up dancing round, this clown commands applause at his show

I had a dream that you were with me
It wasn't my fault
You rolled me over, flipped me over
A somersault
That doesn't happen to me
I've never been here before
I saw forever in my never
And I stood outside her heaven
Heaven, heaven, heaven

I can only dream of you and sleep but I'd never see sunlight again
I can try to be with you, but somehow I'll end up just losing a friend
I can only reach for you, relate to you, I'm losing my friend
Where did she go? Where?

I had a dream that you were with me
It wasn't my fault
You rolled me over, flipped me over
Like a somersault
That doesn't happen to me
I've never been here before
I saw forever in my never
And I stood outside her heaven

Would you let me in your heaven?

And the times can get too bad

That surrounds us is broken
So we learn that life is something
We can't do alone
And there in our sorrow
God is waiting until we let go

When the foundation's shaking
Love will take control
Heavy laden in the shadows
On our knees, out in the cold
Wherever we're letting go
Love is taking hold

Fallen and needing a Savior
We must know that there is help
When we finally give in, oh
Shattered and trembling
We can find strength unending in Him

Fifth grader seventy dollar phone two way pager
I'm a major, in other words I got flavor
I wreck mics rip shows and kick floors

If a ticket was around my neck it would be covered in ice
And my wrist stay blingin it's a lovable site

Often I know I don't see
The waves of love that wash over me
Your love is a paradigm
For a man just looking for the next cheap rhyme
Visualizing paradise is a
Thing I don't wanna do, a thing I don't wanna do

What's gone and what's gonna be
Time chases me, my mind races
To find the place where I wanna be

Yo whassup man, get up man (*urrp* I can't bust man)
Get up nigga, bust (I'm fucked)
Get up you gotta do your verse nigga
(Aight I'll try it) Get up nigga!

Verse One: J-Ro

I get drunk and I stumble to the phone
And conjure up a bitch to bone when I'm alone
Oh shit, tow back, I need to take a piss
Only when I'm drunk I sing a song like this
My grandma and your grandma *urrp*
Sittin' by the fire
Hold on, turn the beat off (nah, keep it goin'
J-Ro can you make it?) I'm just not knowin'
I get drunk and start talkin' mo' shit
And when I got a gun in my hand you better get, out
Cause my brain just ain't what it used to be
Forget tryin' to raionalize, cover your eyes
Ah d-*urrp*, damn I'm drunk
I need a chunk, no better yet a hunk of that funk
When I get drunk I might act uncouth
But when I get drunk I always tell the truth
Yeah I'm good, I'm bad, I'm dope, I'm freaky fresh
I make hip-hop fans say yes yes
The Liks comin' through, you know we gonna blow upop
Hold up, hold up, I think I gotta...
*Urrrrrrp* Damn, false alarm
Gettin' all the ladies with my cool charm
When I get drunk I might even call my daddy a punk
Yeah, but only when I'm dr-*urp* drunk

Yeah, let me pass the forty, to my nigga, Tash

Verse Two: Tash, E-Swift

It goes one for the chronic, two for the amnesia
It's the pimp-slap niggy with drinks in the freezer
Bust the one out, two out, (flips) type of rapper
That'd get you our your seat quicker than a car jacker
Slip a Colt for the fever when I'm coolin with my people
Got hoes in East Columus like I'm BIlly Dee Wrinkle
'Cause I move like, I'm smooth like I'm Harry Belafonte
Lookin' for them niggaz that jumped my homey Dante
All up in this bitch with the gin and Tanqueray
Drink like Mr. Wendal smoke bud like Dr. Dre
But that's 'cause I'm old enough to do that type of shit
Got damn I gotta piss I pass the mic to E-Swift

Yeah, I get drunk and can't nobody whoop me
I'm trippin', must be the brew that I was sippin
Kickin in, guess I shouldn'ta mixed it with the gin
'Cause when I'm layin on my back I can feel the room spin
One too many, I reckon
Feelin' I got ta earl, any second
Wanna get up but can't move, feels like I'm stuck in the groove
What the fuck was I tryin' to prove?
I get a rep for downin four-o's
All the hoes knows them Alkaholik bros
Niggaz call me dad I got a fifth in the trunk
Might fuck an ugly bitch but only when I'm drunk

Verse Three: J-Ro

Aight, think I'm feelin' a little better
Ready to bust this, like this
And ya don't miss, check it out

I get drunk and start thinkin' bout my friends
That passed on with every forty ounce the memory will last on
Black Man Muzzle, Mike Lee and Suavey D
The three MC's will always live in my memories
We used to rock shows, we used to rock hoes
And drink forty-o's, and wear the same clothes
Damn I wish we could go through it again
But I know one day we gonna do it again
And when that day comes it's gonna be live
But I ain't in no hurry so I don't drink and drive
The ALkaholiks we gets funky when we drinkin'
Just a lil sumthin, to pump up the thinkin'

Outro: J-Ro

Ha ha, put the money in the hat"

After Reaganomics crack came and more blood spill
I gotta tell shorties now I don't pop pills
The only ecstacy I fuck with rolls with Jalil
No grip, straight line rhymes
Like the grand concourse on 149
In LA the riders ridge was Fairfax and Olympic ???
On the block the Ethiopians kick it (salaam)
You'll learn Angel City'll test you
I move through giving respect where respect's due
Ducking these cops who say they serve to protect you
And handlin my biz so I ain't tryin' to impress you
It's mind over matter, crew over money
I do strategy, I don't act sporadically
I contemplate, cat I move mathematically
It's Alchemist with Dilated, that's family

Still a couple lessons I can teach
How the real fiends cop two each
The game is keeping dope in the streets
So look the world on wheels
Still a couple lessons I can teach
How the real heads rock real beats
Bangin' out the illest rides on the streets
Look at the world on wheels

Peace King, peace haki, peace queen

I only leave 'em in pieces if they step in the ring
They're fumbling and wondering what weapon to bring
I'm like Ice-T, I know my lethal weapon'll swing
Stop the presses, block the doors
Cops oppress us, watch the wolves
But all the friendly fire is worse than oppression
Pressure more stressin is poured in dead presidents (Rakaa)
Fights for your rights is my pleasure
But suckers swing rulers like swords that try to measure
While Slick Rick the ruler's at war with INS yo
I hope the young fly their best yo
Hip-hop desert again, it's like Busy Bee's buzzin again
My patience is thin though
I ventilate 'em like I cracked the window and air it out like a Hail Mary to the end zone

When I'm all out, I cause panic (peace summits)
When I move stealth (it's mysteries and who-done-its)
I made mental notes of who's fam and who frontin
Mental notes of who ran shit and who runnin'

Und der Himmel in meinem Kopf ist blau
Wenn ich ruhig bin
Und gleichzeitig nach vorn und hinten schau

Wenn ich schwebe
Weil ich alles verzeihen kann
Und plötzlich die Welt versteh
Wenn ich wirklich lebe
Und mich selbst von oben seh

Dann ist Lachen
Lachen wie Weinen
Und Weinen
Weinen wie Lachen

Wenn ich stark bin
Und Menschen um mich sind dabei
Wenn ich mutig bin
Und mich einfach über nichts besonderes freu

Wenn ich springe
Weil die Nächte so schön sind
Und die Tage gar nicht schwer
Immer wenn ich singe
Und mich selbst von innen hör

Dann ist Lachen
Lachen wie Weinen
Und Weinen
Weinen wie Lachen"

But tonight I will find out for once and for all
Tonight I will follow her and let the chips fall
So let the chips fall let them fall where they may
My moment of truth is fast on its way
Soon I will know for once and for all so I'll just cross my fingers and let the chips fall

The life that I'm living is just half a life the girl that I married is just half a wife
But my life without her would be no life at all
Still I must know the truth so let the chips fall
Let the chips fall let them fall where they may

I must hold her hand a man cannot crawl

The moon and the dreams we shared
Your trembling paw in my hand
Dreaming of that northern land
Touching me with a kiss of a beast

I know my dreams are made of you
Of you and only for you
Your ocean pulls me under
Your voice tears me asunder
Love me before the last petal falls

As a world without a glance
Of the ocean's fair expanse
Such the world would be
If no love did flow in thee
But as my heart is occupied
Your love for me now has to die
Forgive me I need more than you can offer me

Didn't you read the tale
Where happily ever after was to kiss a frog?
Don't you know this tale
In which all I ever wanted
I'll never have
For who could ever learn to love a beast?

However cold the wind and rain
I'll be there to ease your pain
However cruel the mirrors of sin
Remember beauty is found within

While we're young and almost free

I've got to lose this skin I'm imprisoned in
Got to lose this skin I'm imprisoned in

Do not turn or hate to see
All the things you think we've got
Do not turn or hate to see
What happened to the wife of Lot

We're alone or so they say
We're not on our own in that way
When we're alone it's real tough going
We can take a part in someone else's play

Come with me, I thought he said
But that's not him anymore, he's dead
What's it like to be so free
So free it looks like lost to me"

The Human Cannonball
Died in Sarasota Monday
Eighty-four was all
From Italy in Thirty-four
John Ringling brought him here
Broken neck in Fifty-one
Ended his career

But in those years in between
Seventeen in all
Few flew as fast or as far
As the Cannonball
Fifty-eight yards and one foot
Was the distance that he went
Fifty-four miles in an hour
The speed that he was sent

Two of his brothers and two daughters
Nine grandchildren in all
And the one great grandchild
Survive the Cannonball
He died on Monday where he lived
It happens to us all
Shot through the air expecting nets
A flight and then a fall"

As you die die die
In this bed not making a sound

It has all come crashing down
To be here and watch you breathe your last
So helpless to stop you from slipping away so fast

Oh God are you listening now
As this cancer dances through her and then takes a bow
It won't disappoint the crowd

Whose words are a curse
As I hear them one by one
Each pull, the string, and I come undone

I know this, I failed to say
(I'm sinking by your side)
You're worth this, I wouldn't trade a day
To not have gone though this

So many days I've been blind,
I want to stop and rewind
Kick off our shoes and dance
With the ghost of you

Who could tease me
And leave me begging for the abuse
You're the only one I knew
That could tame me and make me who I am

But now, it's all fading,
And there's nothing left of all my plans

I know this, I failed to say
(I'm sinking by your side)
You're worth this, I wouldn't trade a day
To not have gone though this

So many days I've been blind,
I want to stop and rewind
Kick off our shoes and dance
Let's dance again,
We'll turn up our sleeves,
I know just where to begin

Dance, let's dance again,
We could find ourselves before this happened

These words of mine are trite and so cliché
And still they find their place in everything
It's just to break the silence that has been crushing me

Half of me is dead, already gone
And half is screaming everyone is wrong
I'm finally asking now will you

Just hear me out
This was all my fault
Now you've brought me death
And it's everything I wanted

It's the wrong side of fear that kept me out"

I like I like to see the edges

Get all wet when you're walking near the water there.
It's real nice to talk to you.
I didn't. i-i-i-i-i ... how are you? how are you?
(Oh albino)

I saw I saw you from your balcony window
And you were standing there waving at everybody
It was really great because there was about
A billion people there, but when I was waving to you,
Uh, the way your face was, it was so,
The way your face was
It made me feel exactly like we're
It's not that you were just waving to me, but
That we were we were waving to each other.
Really it was really wonderful
I really felt happy
It really made me happy
And. um. i. I just wanted to thank you

Because

You really really you made me
You made me feel good
And
Oh i, it's nothing.

When the moon is shining bright
The end of the rainbow promise
Almost in my sight
Sat with my back against cold stone
Waiting for the morning light
And all the things I've seen in dreams
Have kept me up all night
Always reaching to the sky
Soft hard stone
I'm sitting here and thinking
Bout all the centuries its known
Got a feeling someone's near
Listening to the East wind moan
You know there's no one here
But I just don't feel alone

Fading Lady Light
Always here with me
Singing your song in the wind at night
You know I've never felt so free
You're my reality
Don't you fade away from me
The wind it paints your face
As it stirs the shifting sand
Nightmare creatures closing in
They leave at your command
If only you were beside me now
Maybe I would understand
And I could leave my dreams for life
To live the dream we planned"

She said she's happy with her life right now

I just wanna know

What if you were really made for me?

Would that not mean anything?

If you can't be sure your heart is still here with me
Still wanting me

Your friend asked me
If there was someone special in my life that I was seeing
I told her there was no one in particular
There's just i, myself, and me
I told her that I dream of you quite often
She just cut her eyes at me
She said you got a home, you're very happy
So just stop your meddling
I told her that I won't
I said thing were cool, but I guess I was wrong

That could be my house
That could be my baby boy that you're nursing
That could be the trash that I always take out
That could be the chair that I love to chill in
That could be my food at the table at the end of the day
Hugs and the kisses, all the love we make
What the hell do you expect me to say?
What if it's really s'posed to be this way?

To breathe the air and soothe my mind,

And all those things I left behind.

A silent star shone on me,
My eyes saw a far horizon,
As if to pierce this veil of time,
And escape this earthly prison.

Will there come a time when the memories fade.
And pass on with the long, long years,
When the ties no longer bind?

It was all over him your

He was caught up in the game
And the FBI warned if I didn't go along
They'd make sure I never saw my son or my boyfriend again

He gave me anything I could dream (anything)
But the life that he lived was a nightmare I swear
Wasn't clean he was blinded by the cream
All the murderous capers, the trips to Las Vegas
Making millions from paper blood-stained (blood-stain money)
Stuck in my head like a song, I saw every sin I knew every wrong
And if I don't go along, I'd never see my family again

It was Saturday evening, we were home watching TV
He looked in my eyes I wanted to cry (oh)
My son ran to hug him, he kissed him goodnight
How could I do this, blooding do this? When I knew he would die
FED's rushed the door, yelled 'everyone on the floor'
My man pulled his 9 and started to fire
He was a soldier of cause in a war he couldn't win
But without him I'm lost
So I stood by his side and went down with him

Oh
No no no no
No no no no
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh
Ooh

My eternal jam is the juice of the radio
Takin' out profanity so they can play it though
Listen to a hell of a kick and the high hat
Going to the record store say ya gonna buy
That the E is connected to the A and the Z ya say Y
So that's how the beats stack it up on material made of hits
Takin' my time of each line to make sure it fits
Push play on the instrumental that's recorded
Step on stage and I'm suddenly awarded
Some sort of track appeared like a plaque
And some hell of a scream from the girls in the back
Takin' a bow 'cause I got style
Never at the bottom of the ways on the top of the pile
Yo it's Eazy on top even though I'm short
Guarenteed to help when I walk on the court
So get up make some noise for the gangsta clap
Gonna tip the laugh I'm not a pranksta
I'm serious Dre my sounds so quit playin' around
'Cause I'mma break it down

(Eazy-E)
Last time I was takin' my time with this
But other suckaz were makin' a rhyme with this
I had to change the tip or make it hyper
But they was rotten, I was gettin' riper
Ready to go, like never before
Givin' you more because I'm ready to score
Ren is my buddy you can tell I said often
Helpin' me destroy the suckaz that's softin'
Curin' diseases, my rhyme pleases, throw it a key
Balls havin' seasons, this is a doctrine
And I'm locked in, and I made up my mind
And I think I'm gonna rock then
You got beaches chill and I'mma push ya
To freeze after I'll cut ya 'cause I'mma butcher
And say ya have pricin' and then out ya go
Cause a percentage on point bellys are very low
Messin' with a gun but once ya get hurt
Like a said before ya get rubbed in the dirt
I'm not a law man, but I'mma raw man
M.C. Ren: ""But ya the dopest one I ever saw!""
I keep droppin' it pound for pound
And when I'm on the mic I always throw down
To keep y'all dancin' to my funky sound
So listen 'cause I'mma break it down

Now look at me and not the poster
And you could see right off I got the most of
The talent, experience or a trade
And complements for the rhyme that's made
Talks over today if this one so

Nasty like and the girls are like glancin'
Wantin' to get wit me this routine
Keepin' it sprung still stayin' mean
Can ya dis this man I don't think so
Once I start writin' the way I let the ink go
Comin' out with songs like hit after hit
Cause this is legit and yours ain't shit
Makin' it sound so dope 'cause I'm a genius
But your amazed with ya happy to see this
Brother go crazy on wax
Flowin' away like if I was on a sax
Doin' a solo in the shade I'm a spotlight
Relax and chill while your up tight
Pumpin' up the funky sounds
Yo you should know it's kinda persist
That the E is gonna break it down"

O'er hills and meadows we'd stray
Just a boy and his dog, we both full of fun
We grew up together that way

I remember the time at the old swimmin' hole
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
Shep was right there, to the rescue he came
He jumped in and helped pull me out

So the years sped along and at last he grew old
His eyesight was fast growin' dim
Then one day, the doctor looked at me and said
""I can't do no more for him, Jim""

With a hand that was tremblin', I picked up my gun
I aimed it at Shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it, I wanted to run
And I wished they'd shoot me instead

I went to his side and I sat on the ground
He laid his head on my knee
I stroked the best pal that a man ever found
I cried, so I scarcely could see

Old Sheppie, he knew he was goin' to go
For he reached out and licked at my hand
He looked up at me, just as much as to say
""We're partin' but you understand""

Now Old Shep is gone where the good doggies go
And no more with Old Shep will I roam
But if dogs have a Heaven, there's one thing I know
Old Shep has a wonderful home"

That's why I take the time to make it special
Night after night,
Night after night

Everything I have is yours only yours
Nothin' ever touched my soul like this before
Feels so right,

Now if I told you that you're worth the world and all its love to me,
If I told you that I wanna birth a family with you someday
If I told you that I wanna grow old togetha what would you say?
If I was to let you know I wanna see forever with you,
Would you run away?

If I told you I wanna be your drive,
Your strength and courage when your weak

If you knew I'd sacrifice most anything to keep you happy,
Would you let me love you for life?

Dismantle the will of a man
Strip his flesh and bone

Reach out your hand
The moment comes
Blade catches the light of your eyes
The man slowly comes undone

Nobody noticed
No one saw a thing
All turned a blind eye to the fallen
And the bad luck he brings

You wake in the morning after
The sky's a color that you can't see
Friends have fallen by the wayside
Why isn't anyone talking to me
Get those funny looks in the market
People you loved just stare
Wander on with your hands in your pockets
Even your girlfriend don't care

They've all come to watch the emperor
They've all come to watch the emperor
They've all come to watch the emperor

To watch the emperor fall

One part truth
Three parts deceit
Two parts shit that you made up
Add passion for heat

Did ya hear he said this
Can you believe he done that
Can you believe the nerve of the man
Let me at him tell me where he's at
Wake to your fave in the mirror
See someone you don't recognize
Stare at the changes in the reflection
You've become someone that you despise"

And another one must fall down

Fell into the sound in front of me
Unchanged by those around
Directionless, an open sea
We'll watch as time tumbles down

It's enough to give an average, sensitive person the blues.

I don't know about commercial appeal
But what you put in your head
Just can't help affect how you feel
So lets keep it up
Prophets of doom try to capture you
They get around like the asian flu,
But they can't get me
Because I go for the up

I'm on the up side
I look for the up (that down just ain't my style)
I go for the up
I'm hooked on the up
I'm on the upswing (I got my sights set high)
I go for the up


What's the point of standing out in the rain,
What's the sense of looking down,
It just gives your shoulders a pain
Can't get it up
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy
If you look for the worst then that's just
What it turns out to be
So keep looking up
The fickle finger just may point your way
It touches someone different every day,
But it can't touch me
Because I go for the up

And everybody's yelling at me to get back in line,
And they say I'm crazy,
But still they have their sessions of deep depressions,

Quite a few one night stands

Come on, trace the globe and shake ya pants (How many people ready to rock the house?)
Just twist your hip and do the dip (How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on, shake and bake, do whatever it takes (How many people ready to rock the house?)

I wanna get down lower than Atlantis
Going toe to toe with an enchantress
Get funkier than Funkadelic wearin' Pampers
While you eggheads is on the wall preparin' answers
Sharing transcripts while we over here
Dipping and dancin'
Rhythm romancin'
Wallflowers
Giving no action, no
All hours we chillin' and max the flow
Relaxing
Opposites attractin'
I'm-a toss my hat in
Lost when the track spin
Like I'm on a crack binge
Jiggling and wiggling
Freakin' booties, speakin' to the cuties so belligerent
No religion, just bump the feed on
You'll feel reborn
Negativity, we just dead it like decoy
Better lift your feet and just measure the beat on
The pulse when it respond

Tap your toes and clap ya hands (How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on, trace the globe and shake ya pants (How many people ready to rock the house?)
Just twist your hip and do the dip (How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on, shake and bake, do whatever it takes (How many people ready to rock the house?)"

Funk from the fungus grown in the trench
It's getting kinda heavy so I gotta pinch an inch
And it's a snitch

To let my hair grow like a plant
Eliminate the fat gold chains and the diaper pants
Trade 'em for a pair Girbauds
Never make friends with the fraudulent foes

Yes I suppose that I'm fat from the supper
Skinny from the many that try to eat plenty
Now I got to flip on a copper like a penny
Vise uh versa, quench your thirst

With a swig of grapefruit juice straight from the thermos
Hock your jewels, and you can drop your tools
And make a move that can turn us in the right direction
Show your affection as I correct men

Who try to pull the wool over the third eye
Comin' fly with Mr. Greenjeans
It's a bird eye view of the meadow
As I greet the many people that I meet with a hello

""How do you do my compadre?"", What up Kwame?
Back to the Meadow so I can show I'm a
Smooth black brother that is gifted
And if you try to lift this, yes, I got a witness
Nicknamed the Emperor, this wasn't meant for ya'

Where the smoke is hanging still
Like an echo of an age long forgotten.
There's a story of a home
Crushed beneath those blackened stones
And a roof that fell before the beams were rotten.
See, Saul Darby loved his wife
And he laboured all his life
To provide her with material possessions
And he built for her a home
Of the finest wood and stone
And the building soon became his sole obsession.

Oh it took three hundred days
For the timber to be raised
And the silhouette was seen for miles around
And the gables reached as high
As the eagles in the sky
But it only took one night to bring it down --
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.

Though the shared a common bed
There was precious little said
In the moments that were set aside for sleeping.
For his busy dreams were filled
With the rooms he'd yet to build
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.
Then one night he heard a sound
As he laid his pencil down
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle,
And the pale light of the moon, 
Through the windows of the room,
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.

Oh it took three hundred days
For the timber to be raised
And the silhouette was seen for miles around
And the gables reached as high
As the eagles in the sky
But it only took one night to bring it down --
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground."

And it's deeper than Royal blue.

The wailing of the soul!
The prisoner in the dock,
The digger in the hole,
We're in this together... and ever...

In the shade of a jungle glade,
Or the rush of the crushing street,
On the plain, on the foamy main,
You can never escape from the beat.
It's in the mud and it's in your blood
And its conquest is complete.
And all that you can do is just surrender.

To the Majesty of Rock!
The Pageantry of Roll!
The crowing of the cock,
The running of the foal!
The shepherd with his flock,
The miner with his coal,
We're in this together... and ever...

When we die, do we haunt the sky?
Do we lurk in the murk of the seas?
What then? Are we born again?
Just to sit asking questions like these?
I know, for I told me so,
And I'm sure each of you quite agrees:
The more it stays the same, the less it changes!

And that's The Majesty Of Rock!
The Mystery of Roll!
The darning of the sock,
The scoring of the goal!
The farmer takes a wife
The barber takes a pole.

Jesus coming soon.

In the year of 19 and 18, God sent a mighty disease.
It killed many a-thousand, on land and on the seas.

Great disease was mighty and the people were sick everywhere.
It was an epidemic, it floated through the air.

The doctors they got troubled and they didn't know what to do.
They gathered themselves together, they called it the Spanishin flu.

Soldiers died on the battlefield, died in the counts too.
Captain said to the lieutenant, ""I don't know what to do.""

Well, God is warning the nation, He's a-warning them every way.
To turn away from evil and seek the Lord and pray.

Well, the nobles said to the people, ""You better close your public schools.""
""Until the events of death has ending, you better close your churches too.""

The violence and bloodshed in the cold
Going down to the ground
And close to the edge

Calling me away

Nothing is better that my pride.
The prophecy will never dies
Screaming warning after warning
Cries and crimes in the air
Just calling, calling
Calling me again
Yeah

They hurt all my souls
When the creatures of the past, past
Get back to the crowning
Reconquer our side

Now we will get our revenge
But I can not hide
The revelations riding through the night
Can't you feel the pain
So I can not die
Our domination will defeat mankind!

I'll open fire shooting first
The warrior that I am is cursed
You should hide from the oppression, oppression
Bravely self-willed to survive
The prophecy used all my mind
Carry on to feel the glory
The victory is everywhere
Just calling, calling
Calling me away
Dying or calling, calling

Don't save the world it's too late
They said, we will not close the curtain
Rising up to the sky I am changing our ways
Reaching the power to live in liberty

Don't save the world it's too late
Hand in hand we all must keep the faith
Fight eternally.
Don't tell me now it's too late
Mighty eternally
We needs the crowning glory

Y sigo pensando en ti

Conversations prying, baking with passing down the wisdom

Words she washed with tears and planted in my soul

Can we just go back to the simple kinda living?
Can we just go back and maybe start from the beginning?
Back to better days, when love was for the giving
Can we just go back to the way we were?

Mama said there was a time when brothers were each others keepers
Sisters held each other close till there was nothing left between them
Back when a song was a song you could sing along didn't matter how long
Just as long as it spoke to ya, sung to ya
Do you know what I mean?

Now I'm chasing rainbows and dreams,
Trying hard to believe
This is how it could be
Yesterday was yesterday, tomorrow's just a day away
By then it may be too late, maybe we can start today"

Las dos nos paró a los dos

Well, just what makes you think it's all for the best?
Do you care, can you feel the pain?
Two billion people being starved for your gain

It seems that growth never keeps us with need
Too many mothers got too many mouths to feed
Damned if we do, we'll be damned if we don't
Things have to change and we all know that they won't

Will things get better?
Well, who can tell?
But if this is Heaven
Then show me Hell!

Build swords from plowshares, squeeze blood from a stone
And when they've used you, you'll be left on your own!
There seems no hope as we race towards the fall
The war machine will consume us all

Violence and bloodshed, the folly of man
They call it progress, I call it a scam
Push blindly forward without asking why
The rich gets richer, the poor can all die!

Will things get better?
Well, who can tell?

The colored folks do the hard labor and wear the blue uniforms

They handed her a broom and said

She's the highest paid sweeper in town
And I'm the luckiest guy in the world

Saying nasty things, making smart little remarks
But she never cries, not until she's in my arms
Why, even her own folks won't speak to her
And at times, I bet her poor little heart is as blue as the uniform she wears
Yep, when she gets off she'll be tired, but she'll smile
Midst the sneers, the leers, and the jeers and the curse words
She'll smile, 'cause you know love can conquer anything
It can climb the highest mountain, swim the deepest ocean
Bridge the widest gap, even between men's hearts
Yep, love is the great cleanser
Take an old pair of dungarees
The more they're washed, the whiter they get

I'd stay awake cause my nightmares was seein' him dead
The smell of burnt tires peelin after leavin' him lead
The killer fled with a fuckin' laugh
My heart pumpin on blast
I just stare at him slumped in the grass
Arms movin, fingers shakin, spittin' up blood

And all of a sudden heads turnin', somebody did sumthin
This nigga named, I forgot, fuck it he lived around the block
Regular getting' money nigga but loved to clown a lot
Walk across the park stuntin' and frontin'
Diamonds in his ears, diamond watch on, eatin a bag of popcorn
Walked up behind a shorty and grabbin' her waist
She pushed him away
So he threw the bag in her face
She felt disrespected, shorty couldn't accept it
Called him a pussy told him she'd be back in a second
But he ain't payin' no mind called her a bitch about 4 times
Stayed in the park, with no niggas with him and no nine
And then in no time an older nigga from behind
Swung a baseball bat
Left his face all crack
Told him to take all that
Hit him again popped his chain with a frown
And left the clown with a stain on the ground

If we, roll up quickly, stick me, some was tipsy

But I don't know scarface or Bushwick Bill, My heart spills
For the kids who ain't got nothing and who got to steal, and from my

There's a light we can love on the way
There is a wonder and wildness to life
And freedom for those who obey

And all those who seek it shall find it
A pardon for all who believe
Hope for the hopeless and sight for the blind

To all who've been born in the Spirit
And who share incarnation with Him
Who belong to eternity stranded in time
And weary of struggling with sin

Forget not the hope that's before you
And never stop counting the cost
Remember the hopelessness when you were lost

There is a joy in the journey
There's a light we can love on the way
There is a wonder and wildness to life
And freedom for those who obey

And freedom for those who obey..."

Durch die Wälder Asgards, Gullveig rief man sie.
Als sie vor den Toren Valhalls Einlass begehrte,
Öffneten die Asen ihr, voller Sympathie.
Gullveigs lächeln hatte Macht ihr Plan war ein gemeiner.
Mit der Kraft der Schönheit hat sie Odins Volk getrügt.

Einmal in der Feste luden Odin und die andren
Gullveig ein zutrinken, sie nahm an.
Als das Fest gefeiert wurde fing sie an zu reden
Über Gold und Geld und was man damit alles kann.
Viele Asen hörten zu und fingen an zu schmachten,
Wollten Reichtum, stritten dann und schlugen aufeinander ein.

Als der Streit am ärgsten war, die Asen sich bekriegten,
Blickte Vater Odin, Gullveig ins Gesicht.
Er sah wie sie lachte, wie sie dieser Groll erfreute.
Dass dort Schwerter kreisten, darum scherte sie sich nicht.
""Brüder"", rief er ""haltet ein! Das Weib will uns vernichten.
Zwietracht ist der Hexensaat, es keimt in ihrem Blut!""

Kaum gesprochen endete der Kampf der Asenmeute.
Alle blickten jählings auf die Hexe voller Hass.
Gullveig fühlte Augenblicklich, dass die List nicht glückte.
Sie fing an zu zittern, wurde plötzlich leichenblass.
Odin schrie: ""Dein falsches spiel soll deinen Tod besiegeln.
Brennen sollst du Hexenweib, dein Ende sei gewiss!""

Augenblicklich stürzten sich die Asen auf die Hexe,
Banden sie und schlugen ihr die Fäuste in den Leib.
Odin sprach: ""Der Scheiterhaufen soll dein Ende bringen,
Niemand stört der Asenruhe UND NUN BRENNE WEIB!""
Kaum gesprochen ward es wahr, die Hexe stand in Flammen.
Als das Feuer ausgebrannt war, lachte Gullveig laut.

""Niemand ist imstande, mir mein Leben zu entreißen"",
Sprach die Riesin, doch die Asen taten es erneut.
Weitere zwei Male wollten sie das Weib entzünden,
Doch die Hexe starb nicht und das hat sie nicht erfreut.
Gullveig floh nach Osten, um den Asen zu entrinnen.
Odin und die seinen blieben Ahnungslos zurück"

Living high, stay low
Kicking it out in style
Another day, another dollar, another notch in the belt
Kick it out
Fallen down

Where the day goes
Where the day
Where the day takes your underground uplifting
Where the day eludes truth, lies, opinion
Where the day takes you

Running red, sorry for humanity
Say you're lovesick in her world
Turning tricks
Another angel gets her wings
Clipped away
Old soul of love words of lovesick
Sad parade gone by
Gone by
Locked and settled down
They prey the proud, the proud
Don't you want love
Save your lungs, your shit, your life
Make a bad choice"

I can't bare to spend my life alone
Just waiting on your ghost
And living without you
I'm afraid that wouldn't do
You have to believe me
I can't spend one night alone
Without your breath in my ear
I'm empty without it
And I'm afraid I couldn't live

Maybe there's a chance that I could carry on with your memory
Maybe there's a hope that I could live in the shell you left of me
Maybe I could last a while as the poster child for tragedy
I'm afraid that couldn't be

The silence is deafening
Must I face another day
Without the rhythm of your voice
That echoes inside me
It's a song I'll never sing

It's a thing I couldn't do
It's a thing I couldn't do
It's a thing I couldn't do

I afraid that couldn't be

I can't bear to spend my life
I can't bear to spend this life
I can't bear to spend my life alone"

Stand before me
As I leave the hall
To heed this call

High above
Roses climb
As evening's hours die
A distant cry

I must leave
All behind
Shed all those ties that bind
My tethered mind

Darkened light
I must take care
Never shine to bright
Stay out of sight

Once, on a windswept shore
I stood alone
Sensed that far cry
Across the reach

Tool the bell
For this sad world
Was my prison cell
A pleasant hell

End this pain
End my time
In this blind god's domain
Of brutal claim

Fragrant night
Give me shelter
From these stars too bright
And hide my flight"

Well we never had a lot of cash
But we loved those kids
Some say that she missed the boat
But she just burned the bridge

Stomachache Sundays
And books we never read
Well I was hoping one day
We might meet again
She used to talk about astrology
She was born in June
She danced with strangers and celebrities
Empty stars and the full moon
I was thinking about the universe
For what its worth
Or the one about the Phoenix bird
That died and then returned
The angels love you more than you know
Raised on robbery and rock' n roll

An unspeakable affair
The lady on the hill 
Creates a glorious 
Departure from her every time 
Or everyday life
Constant swelling of the ankles

A pleasant cry for help 
A pleasant cry for help
A pleasant cry for help

A grieving widow mothered this headless wonder
A perfect crime that soon lived on
A different life it had to develop
Gripped by every limb it could hold
The lifeless ideas it grew onto its own
A much needed surrender
Trees soon started to grow from what seemed a lifeless neck

From a monster to a beauty in quick months
Its life seemed to be on its way to a rare freedom
It decided it should take advantage
Advantage of this idea
Of this idea!

A mixture of plantings soon took course in its body
A spectacle none-the-less
Walking proud through life letting its branches guide the way
A path which seemed to be covered in sunshine

It must be human, for its qualities seem
To outdo even the grandest occupant of the town

This started to catch the attention of the un-branched
It had never experienced an affection of this kind
A wonderful and frightening new obstacle in its life
A wonderful and frightening new obstacle in its life

Years went by as it finally found its true love 
The love of others
Others!
Three to be exact
Letting them into every secret
Feeding from every branch
Every part used for their lives

It noticed its walking seemed more staggered than normal
The breeze didn't flow like it used to
The heart seemed to pound slower and slower
What caused this?
(What caused this?)
It soon was noticed that these three had torn every branch, every single stem

Torn to its last life
How hadn't it noticed?
A drastic change in the surroundings
It didn't think anything could go this wrong

Comfort! 
Comfort!
Comfort!
Comfort!
Comfort!
Comfort!
Comfort!
Comfort! 

It thought life was constant happiness, if constant happiness was all that was given out (Given out!)
It thought life was constant happiness, if constant happiness was all that was given out (Given out!)

Comfort!

Caught between the Scylla and Charybdis
Hypnotized by you if I should linger

I have only come here seeking knowledge
Things they would not teach me of in college

Turned into a shining band of gold

I know what you're up to just the same

You will see it come to its fruition

Vanish in the air, you'll never find me

Tourne la vie, mais restent les amours

Avec sa viole et ses chansons;
Chanta la volupté païenne,
La chanta jusqu'au petit jour
Pour l'enfant blonde en mal d'amour,
La si triste et toujours lointaine

Mais devint-il son bel amant ?

Toujours est-il que le seigneur
Fit égorger le doux chanteur,
Pour un regard vers la hautaine

Mais quand les gens voient tournoyer
Toutes les feuilles des noyers,
Marie tend son visage en peine
Car l'on dit que, tendre et fervent,
Son ami prend l'âme du vent
Pour caresser de son haleine

Apartment 108
I'll always keep you in my heart
Anderson is cold tonight,
The leaves are scattered on the ground
I miss the seasons in the comfort of your smile

Sometimes this song feels like a dream,
I'm waiting for someone just to wake me up from this life
As I look out on these fairgrounds,
I remember how our family split apart

I don't think I ever told you,
But I know you always did your best
In the hard times that only made us stronger

As I sit here all alone,
I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on
When you're gone

I'll never be the same without you,
I love you more than you will ever know
So maybe now you finally know:
Sometimes we're helpless and alone,
But you can't let it keep you weighted down
You must go on

Do you ever feel like crying?
Do you ever feel like giving up?
I raise my hands up towards the sky
And say this prayer for you tonight,
Because nothing is impossible

As I sit here all alone,
I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on
When you're gone

I'll never be the same without you,
I love you more than you will ever know
So maybe now you finally know:
Sometimes we're helpless and alone,
But you can't let it keep you weighted down
You must go on

The hardest part isn't finding what we need to be,
It's being content with who we are

Stay who you are

Stay who you are
Stay who you are

Stay who you are
Stay who you are"

And, oh, what a wreck you've made me

Are you there over the ocean?

My hope is on the horizon
Every face, your eyes I can see

Call this bitch yor nigga when time is rough
I lost a lot when you fell, life is hard to bluff
You think its hell where you at
Shit its hell on the streets
You maintaining in the Bing, I'm surviving to eat
Don't think am wilding, flexing whips and stuff
Thinking I'm lost laying down
Sex for trips and stuff
I'll admit it I'm use to the finer things,
We had major names even on the minor things
Everywhere we went, mad bitches sizing me up
You know they tight now, shit I get to drive the trucks
But I wish you were spreading it riding it rough
I think I miss that more then you buying me stuff
Since you got knocked your man tried to hollar at me
And those nigga's you stuck, they throwing dollars at me
But you know this gaming, and I'm just keeping it real
Holding you down until you back on the field

Feels like I do
I feel when feeling down
In the ground feeling down
It can be most anyday

Don't worry 'bout these streets I'm conrolling these grounds
I might slip and miss a V-I but I'm holding it down
Got the kids to take care its hard out here
And its tearing my heart to play my part out here
I seen that snitch and you know I got plots 4 years
And your bid make me feel like I got the chair
But ain't nobody tapping this I rather tap my own
Watching tapes we made while I'm resting alone
Wishing you home, pictures of you flipping the chrome
What kind of chic will leave her man when he out the zone
Me without you is like a stickman without a silencer
Got me X-ing off days on the calendar
I miss loading the glock so you could control the block
I miss watching you work the dogs to tighten the lock
Think of the time boo pushing it like a 6 double o
You get your weight up I'm a drain you once they let go


I can see us back on the bricks, me on your shoulder
Letting bitches know they wishes to have you are over
So you ring your broads while you locked away
I know its hard for a nigga on top not to play
See Amil's the one you kept draped in ice
I'm the one waiting silk down caked in spice
Waiting for your calls or my box to vibrate
Hoping you want me to come scoop you not being more weight
I fell from Gucci sandals back to no name brands
From a six and a mansion to beating the sands
Staying true make ends meet to have enough for the love I take
All-savage and stuff
Have a brick where most F.E.D.S. dare to touch
Fear none to see the cash, and us popping the clutch
Chopping a Dutch-flip cop twice as much living low key
A minute then heist and stuff
If I have to wait while you gone I'm a take what comes
If you don't see cash, know its hard in the slums
'Cause I ran through the stash and it ain't no funds"

Hurry doctor come, need to get me some
You know what time it is

I think I'm coming down with something
I know it gonna need your medicine
So help me now, I'm freaking out lover

This love is serious (everybody knows I'm mad for you)
You get me seriously out of my mind
And I am so into us (let no one get hold of you)
Baby you're mine (you're seriously fine)

And you know I can't stand
How the girls all wanna be getting all up in my place
So get off of my man and don't try to mess with me
Cause this love is serious, we're seriously onto something

You got me so delirious, I'm under your control
Point it at me if you must, your arrow's got me poisoned
Tell me what my treatment is, your love's got me insane
My prescription is your kiss and boy you got me wantin' it"

He was dressed as a bag of leaves
It hid the braces on his legs at first

His smile was as bright as the August sun
When he looked at me
As he struggled down the driveway, it almost
Made me hurt

Will don't walk too good
Will don't talk too good
He won't do the things that the other kids do,
In our neighborhood

I've been searchin', wonderin', thinkin'
Lost and lookin' all my life
I've been wounded, jaded, loved and hated
I've wrestled wrong and right
He was a boy without a father
And his mother's miracle
I've been readin', writin', prayin', fightin'
I guess I would be still
Yeah, that was until
I knew God's Will

Will's mom had to work two jobs
We'd watch him when she had to work late
And we'd all laugh like I hadn't laughed
Since I don't know when

Hey Jude was his favorite song
At dinner he'd ask to pray
And then he'd pray for everybody in the world but him

Before they moved to California
His mother said, they didn't think he'd live
And she said each day that I have him, well it's just
Another gift
And I never got to tell her, that the boy
Showed me the truth
In crayon red, on notebook paper, he'd written
Me and God love you

I've been searchin', prayin', wounded, jaded
I guess I would be still
Yeah that was until...

I want to be a forester
Run through the moss on high heels
That's what I'll do
Throwing out a boomerang
Waiting for it to come back to me

When I grow up
I want to live near the sea
Crab claws and bottles of rum
That's what I'll have
Staring at the seashell
Waiting for it to embrace me

I put my soul in what I do
Last night I drew a funny man
With dog eyes and a hanging tongue
It goes way bad
I never like that sad look
From someone who wants to be loved by you

I'm very good with plants
When my friends are away
They let me keep the soil moist
On the seventh day I rest
For a minute or two
Then back on my feet to call for you

You've got cucumbers on your eyes
Too much time spent on nothing
Waiting for a moment to arise
The face in the ceiling
And arms too long
I'm waiting for him to catch me

Waiting for it to embrace me oh"

Catching light as it goes by
Like comet trails streaking across the sky
And ride it down to anywhere you are

If I'm not right there next to you
And a word can't travel across the room
That anytime you're gone you're gone too far

Hold up your hands
The wave comes in at the edge of the land

No batteries included, and no strings attached
No holds barred, no time for move faking

Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fuming, I've had it up to here

And wow how now wow how now, Brown cow

But the rest are doo-doo
From radio to the video to Arsenio
Tell me, yo, what's the scenario

Scenarios, radios, rates more than four
Scores for the smores that smother dance floors
Now I go for mine, shades of seashore
Ship-shape crushed grapes, apes that play tapes
Papes make drakes, baked for the wakes
Of an L-ah, and -eader, simply just a leader
Bass in the space means ""peace, see ya later""
Later (later), later alligator
Pop blows the weasel and the herb's the inflator

Laugh yo, how'd that sound (ooh)

It's a Leader Quest mission and we got the goods here (here)
Never on the left cause my right's my good ear (ear)
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal
Stay away from crime so I ain't no criminal
I love my young nation, groovy sensation
No time for hibernation, only elation
Don't ever try to test the water, little kid
Yo Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell 'em what I did

I heard you rushed and rushed, and attacked
Then they rebuked, then you had to smack
Causing rambunction throughout the sphere
Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear

You know I did it
So don't violate or you'll get violated
The hip-hop sound is well agitated
Won't ever waste no time on the played out ego
So here's Busta Rhymes with the scenario

Watch as I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come rewind
Powerful impact (boom) from the cannon
Not bragging, try to read my mind, just imagine
Vocabulary's necessary
When digging into my library
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh
Eating Ital Stew like the one Peter Tosh
Uh, uh, uh, all over the track, man
Uh, pardon me, uh, as I come back
As I did it, yo I heard you beg your pardon
When I travel through the town, I roll with the squadron
Roar, roar, like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers cause your pants are sagging
Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban
And have you smelling ripe like some old stale urine
Chickity-choco, the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel, butt cheeks they were kicking
Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme
The rhythm is in sync (uh) the rhymes are on time (time)
Ripping up this dance just like Horatio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario

For my talents are renowned far and wide (wide)
When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night
I excel without ever even trying

With the slightest little effort of my ghostlike charms
I have seen grown men give out a shriek
With the wave of my hand and a well-placed moan
I have swept the very bravest off their feet

Yet year after year, it's the same routine
And I grow so weary of the sound of screams
And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King
Have grown so tired of the same old thing

Oh, somewhere deep inside of these bones
An emptiness began to grow
There's something out there, far from my home
A longing that I've never known

I'm a master of fright and a demon of light
And I'll scare you right out of your pants
To a guy in Kentucky, I'm Mister Unlucky
And I'm known throughout England and France

And since I am dead, I can take off my head
To recite Shakespearean quotations
No animal nor man can scream like I can
With the fury of my recitations

But who here would ever understand
That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin
Would tire of his crown, if they only understood
He'd give it all up if he only could

Oh, there's an empty place in my bones
That calls out for something unknown
The fame and praise come year after year
Does nothing for these empty tears"

Up to my ears in dragonflies

And you try to run, but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
And then you're in the man from Mars
You go out at night eating cars

You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns, too
Mercurys, and Subaru
And you don't stop
You keep on eating cars
Then when there's no more cars

You go out at night
And eat up bars where the people meet

Dance cheek to cheek

One to one
Man to man
Dance toe to toe
Don't move too slow

'Cause the man from Mars is through with cars
He's eating bars
Yeah, wall to wall
Door to door
Hall to hall
He's gonna eat 'em all

Take a tour through the sewer
Don't strain your brain
Paint a train
You'll be singing in the rain
Said don't stop, do the punk rock

Well, now you see what you want to be
Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars where the TV's on
Now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race

And you hip hop
And you don't stop
Just blast off
Sure shot

Because the man from Mars stopped eating cars
And eating bars
And now he only eats guitars

Rollin' a spliff that'll probably put my soul in a twist
But I remain bonin' a bitch
Got her buck-naked posin' for flicks
Actin' like she was never known for the shit
But I look over the shoulder and see the enemy lookin'
Physically strong but mentally shooken
And for penetentiary bookin's this shit happens
Get orders from my nigga Charlemagne the ship Captain
You sound like a bitch yappin'
This shit is all Natural to us
Like blowin' endo out the window in the back of the bus
I move back and I bust
Rapid fire
You actin' flyer
Now your family's in black attire
With mad desire
When we caught you in the line of duty
You had it in your mind to shoot me
But every soldier of my kind sollutes me
Now I'm reclinin' with a Lucy
All of my niggas
Smoke it down to the filter
Holdin' a frown with a picture
You smell the smoke when I walk past
You saw blasts
You should've known about the drama in my warpath.

Mayday Mayday, raise the white flags, time for the payday,

And West, put on your shield, lets see who's the best. Repeat 1x

You squirm in submission
No terms and conditions
Y'all confirm my suspicions
That y'all are bitches that resemble Men
Like female Tennis players at Wimbledon
Why you tremblin'?
Shook like the ricter
My voice raise waves
And make y'all change ways like crooks turnin' Muslim
Blast shots burnin' your Bosom
Like bitch cramps
You got lucky your people told you switch camps
Or get damp with plenty led
I'm like a beast with many heads
Sort of like the Predators dreads
I got more arms than Dr. Octavious
Rock your whole block radius
I be the bomb
And I bleed nitrogliceren if you slice my palm
The Don been gone for how long from the rap biz?
Wet more domes than John the baptist
When the gat spits
It ain't over till the last man's limbs
Are twisted like he was doin' Yoga
In fact my Pistol's longer than the Jokers
I ignite Mag's
Leave your toe wearin' a white tag
So, y'all niggas better raise the white flag.

I swear there's a war in the air in the New York streets
You talk beef?
You had a swollen Melon, now you humble
With loaded weapons, nowhere to run to
We mega high, jet in the sky, droppin' bombs,
Prepare to crumble as we rock on,
Beware of the jungle with Anaconda's
Don't puff too much 'cause the enemy smells the Marijuana
We blastin' every object in Combat with honor
So yo, remember the agenda with the plan of action
No retreat, no surrender, keep the cannons blastin'
We blastin' heat till each member turns into has-beens
Soldiers bangin', who's click'll get done?
My crew can taste victory at the tip of the tongue
Always prepared physically, take the clip for the gun
And put it in, 'cause when it's on how many niggas'll run?
You said we couldn't win, bullets in ya flesh, cave in your chest
You pullin' for breath, I'm claimin' your death
You shouldn't've stepped, war paint on my chest
Fatigue green and black
And the heat reacts
To make you bleed like hemophiliacs
See me strapped, heavily armed, repetitively
Releasin' caps till the enemy's gone, definitely
My people pack metal for me, let a legend be born
I declare war, (What mothafucka!) and it's on."

The little things that we tell ourselves day after day
To find some escape
And deny all the problems we don't want to face

And you know that it's true that we're all believing
Lies
The ones that we use to define our lives
Lies
We can't face the truth so we wear a disguise
And you can't deny that we're all believing
Lies

What's hiding under your bed
Is it more of the stuff you make up in your head
Do you just pretend
That you have all the answers when nothing makes sense

Can you show me some proof
For all the things you believe when you don't have a clue
The human excuse
To buy into the stories that sound good to you

And you know that it's true that we're all believing
Lies
The ones that we use to define our lives
Lies
We can't face the truth so we wear a disguise
And you can't deny that we're all believing lies

It's only yourself your deceiving
You better believe it
We're all believing lies
The ones that we use to define our lives
Lies
We can't face the truth so we wear a disguise

We're all believing lies
The ones that we use to define our lives

Got a question mark in my heart,
And when evil overcomes me, find myself
Crying out for a brand new start.

It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives
We can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind
I'd live a thousand lives
Each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less than perfect circumstance
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't wanna face what's wrong or right
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart

Sometimes I think that a true love can never be
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about
A deeper love I've found in you
And I no longer doubt
You've touched my heart and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't wanna face what's wrong or right
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart

I locked away my heart
But you just set it free
Emotions I felt
Held me back from what my life should be
I pushed you far away
And yet you stayed with me
I guess this means
That you and me were meant to be"

I wouldn't say

Ginger, to imitate Ginger, now
Is my sole ambition to date
Bolero, with Raft I could share
But with Blair I could never have faced

But it's a cruel, mean old world
And a true Moulin Rouge pearl
When somebody's hustlin' you
Right off of the stage
You'd never be so dumb as to say

Dancer, I'm an old fashioned dancer
And I'll be checkin' you out in the wings
Lady, my poor little lady now
Tryin' so hard to be slim

But it's a cruel, mean old world
And a true Moulin Rouge pearl
When somebody's hustlin' you
Right off of the stage

The Scotsman sips his whiskey toddy

My curse on him that brings me coffee
I'll drink porter, if I may
It makes me feel content and happy

Water is all right in tea
For fish, and things that swim in rivers
The poor man and the beggar, too

If they'd money enough to spend
It's pints of porter they'd be drinking
Porter quaffed down with a laugh

Water is all right in tea
For fish, and things that swim in rivers
The miser hoards and stores his gold
The bee collects the summer honey
When that miser's dead and cold
Someone else will kiss his money

For fish, and things that swim in rivers
Some go in for counting beads
More go in for chasing women

Who says its easy to live with me
Easy or not I appreciate the shot
And I know deep down inside it was meant to be

Your world is the ground under my feet
No way I'm giving up my seat
I may finally know now what I've got
'Cause you've always been my best shot

You're the little girl that rules my world
I know its got to be a hard pill to swallow
But when I see you walk by I get stars in my eyes
Together were a hard act to follow

You're the only girl out there
Who says its easy to live with me
Easy or not I appreciate the shot
And I know deep down inside it was meant to be

Yeah

Tired of teaching you all of your lessons"

Translation:
Where are you Love? 
Yesterday I looked for you... 
on the floor, and in the sky, Dearest... 
and I didn't find you. 
I can't think that you're hiding from me 
Because my silence is sincere... 
It says 'yes' 
Where are you Love? 
Come, return for me... 
that my life knots like an eight... 
if you're not here.. 
I want to think... 
that you won't falter... 
because on this planet, no one else exists that I could love. 
Chorus: 
Where are you Love? 
I looked for you yesterday 
WHere are you Love? 
And I didn't find you 

Where are you Love? 
You left here.. 
Looking for who-knows what... 
so far from me... 
and I can think.... 

and continue to think... 
that you won't falter 
because on this planet.. 
no one else exists... 
that I could possibly love. 
(Repeat Chorus) 

I looked for you 
in the wardrobe 
In the phone book 
under the car 
in black and in white 
in History books 
in magazines 
and on the radio. 
I searched for you in the streets 
You're Mother's 
A bootmaker's stand(?) 
In my change purse 
In two thousand religions 
I've even looked for you in my songs"

Some even that have talked with them
So nice and handsome
""Please, don't be such a fool!
Tell everyone that the witches come tonight""

Your will has gone
""Divine the wicked multitude
Worship your servitude""

Of the mighty old oak

Keep on singing my tale
Deny the Trows kind
Don't you dare to stay behind?
Through years and centuries,
Through myth and poetry
Our race's slowly dying
In the heart of mankind

Deep in the woods
They're dressed with the fruits of earth
Arcane adorers of the roots
Dance Henking tonight

Followeed by the Redcaps
They're greddy for silver and gold

I don't eat no meat.

Only ripe vegtables, fresh fruit and whole wheat.
I'm from the old school, my household smells like soul food, bro.
Curry falafel, barbequed tofu.
No fish, or none of dem candy bars.
No ciggarettes.
Only ganja, and fresh squeezed juice from oranges.
Excerisin' daily, to stay healthy.
An I rarely drink water out the tap 'cause it's filthy.

Lentil soup - is- mental fruit
And, ginger root- is good for the youth.
Fresh vegetables with the ital stew.
Sweet yam fries with the green caleoo
Careful how you season and prepare your foods,
Cause you don't want to lose - vitamins and minerals
And that's the jewel-
Life brings.
Life is valuable, so I eat what comes from the ground- It's natural.
Let your food be your medicine. No exceteran.
Strictly herb, generates from the sun.
'Cause I got MELANIN.
Drink water. 8 glasses a day.
Cause that's what they say.

They say you are what you eat.
So I strive to eat healthy.
My goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy.
Cause true wealth, comes from good health and wise ways.
That's why we gotta start takin' better care of ourselves.

Be Healthy Y'all.

Somebody daughter gettin' it the question which one
Yacked up and on good dro, body numb
Let me show you how a real goon have fun

Y'all in trouble tonight we got the club locked
We ain't dancin over here all we do is bop
One thang fa sho we got them hammers cocked
Look at all the dimes sweat us, they comin' by the flock
Look at the lil hater over there, got him hot
Seen him lookin' at me so I held up a knot
I don't know if you know homie I run the spot
And don't cha play wit me, you ain't got enough shots
Order mine straight up, drank it on the rocks
Been in the club five minutes and done closed shop
How can one nigga be this gotdamn hot?
I don't know if it's me it might be the watch!

Slid through the club late all I need is a hour
Like they told me lil homie money is power
Ran the streets all day I'm fresh out the shower
Watch how a goon rock let me show you my vaulue
Check my track record homie all I beat is stallions
I done smashed already shit you can have her
If you want her better catch her better gon snatch her
Want straight animals over here, no hackers
Better put the cuffs on her fore the goons pack her
When we leave the club watch you follow after
Y'all ain't groupies baby stop bein embarrassed
This one here in the book, this a closed chapter"

Comin' down
Yeah, there's a pink world
Comin' down
In a quite little village by the sea
I hear the calling and it calls for you and me
So leave your riches and your houses on the hills
Cancel all your credit cards and settle up your bills
Cause you won't need them anymore
Close down the factories
Blow up all the stores
Cause there's a pink world
Comin' down
Yeah, there's a pink world
Comin' down
Once I stood in new york city with a sign
Sayin', ""the end is comin', friends
Repent while there's still time""
I will admit that no one really seemed to hear
They would laugh and point their fingers
At my sandals and my beard
But now they'll listen when I say
I have proof, 'cause I read it in the supermarket today
There's a pink world

And it will sweep you away
Yes it rolls like an avalanche
And it will carry us away"

Sur un paquebot de contrebande
Pas dans un bastringue marseillais
Avec des marins qui lui demandent
Une chambre d'hôtel sur la mer
Histoire de faire le tour du monde
D'être la fiancée du corsaire
Tout en restant une putain de blonde

Qui chanterait blue bayou
En dansant sur les tables
Tout en étant capable
De faire peur aux voyous
Et chanter only you
En buvant dans les verres
Un fond de picon bière
Qui rend à moitié fou

Elle voulait jouer Cabaret
Pas les serveuses les filles de salle
Pourtant Dieu sait qu'elle s'en foutait
D'avoir le coeur et les mains sales
Elle venait d'une grande ville du nord
Où on a fermé les usines
Là où le soleil vaut de l'or
Elle savait depuis toute gamine

Elle voulait jouer Cabaret
Pas les madelons d'infortune
Je peux vous dire qu'elle en rêvait
D'un jazz band sous un clair de lune
D'un chapeau claque avec des strass
Comme les vedettes américaines
Pas d'un néon sur la terrasse
Et l'accordéon qui se traîne"

And I might just fuck her too,
If I ever catch her sliding or riding through the (Streets of Compton),
Rolling down Green Leaf smoking on that green leaf,
With a Mac 10 like I was born on Queen's Street,

That how I show you palm niggas where the King is,
And you don't wanna play chess on a time clock,

Is forever enough, is forever enough?

Is forever enough?
'Cause I'm never, never giving you up

I slip in bed when you're asleep
To hold you close and feel your breath on me
Tomorrow there'll be so much to do
So tonight I'll drift in a dream with you

How long do you want to be loved?
Is forever enough, is forever enough?
How long do you want to be loved?
Is forever enough?
'Cause I'm never, never giving you up

As you wander through this troubled world
In search of all things beautiful
You can close your eyes when you're miles away
And hear my voice like a serenade

Once upon a time not long ago
Everybody had on their radio
And then the fella came on with a groovy noise
To put the wiggle in the women and girls and boys
The word got around about three cool cats
Who put the ?foot?, BACK, in the pack
And let me tell you party people just who we be
With the help of Big Bank and the Master G

I could have ordinary people chasing me from town to town

They've got a spy for every blink of your eye

I'm feeling awkward
I'm feeling tongue-tied
They've got a knife for every time you take the same train into work
A family's like a loaded gun
You point it in the wrong direction someone's gonna get killed

If you had such a dream
Would you get up and do the things you believed in?

Is he your husband?
Or just your boyfriend?
Is he the moron who's been beating you and keeping you inside?
I've never done this kind of thing
But if I kill him now, well who's going to miss him?

I went up to the school
I took a walk up Castlehill
For every step there was a local boy who wants to be a hero
Do you wanna do it now?
Outside the butcher's with a knife and a bike chain

If you had such a dream
Would you get up and do the things you believed in?

If you had such a dream
Would you get up and do those things?

Would you get up and do those things?

Woman speaking in background (from ""Rip Van Winkle"" by Washington Irving):

""Times grew worse and worse with Rip Van Winkle as years of matrimony rolled on; a tart tempter never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue is the only edge tool that grows keener by constant use. For a long while he used to console himself, when driven from home, by frequenting a kind of perpetual club of the sages, philosophers, and other idle personages of the village, which held its sessions on a bench before a small inn, designated by a rubicund portrait of his majesty George the Third. Here they used to sit in the shade, through a long lazy summer's day, talking listlessly over village gossip, or telling endless sleepy stories about nothing. But it would have been worth any statesman's money to have heard the profound discussions that sometimes took place, when by chance an old newspaper fell into their hands, from some passing traveller. How solemnly they would listen to the contents, as drawled out by Derrick Van Bummel, the schoolmaster, a dapper learned little man, who was not to be daunted by the most gigantic word in the dictionary..."""

Don't need your help.

Now the rain turns into snowfall as the,

And it covers up the cars,
And the Wall-flowers CD ended half an hour ago.

And drive to find the show,

Not coming home,
She's gone to the movies now and she's,

Now he looks around his place and anyways,
There's nowhere she could sit besides the bed,
And he wonders if the car will start tomorrow,
Or he'll have to take the bus instead.

The seers and the prophets had foretold it long ago
That the long awaited one would make men stumble
But they were looking for a king to conquer and to kill
Who'd have ever thought He'd be so weak and humble
He will be the truth that will offend them one and all
A stone that makes men stumble
And a rock that makes them fall
Many will be broken so that He can make them whole
And many will be crushed and lose their own soul
Along the path of life there lies a stubborn Scandalon
And all who come this way must be offended
To some He is a barrier, To others He's the way
For all should know the scandal of believing
It seems today the Scandalon offends no one at all
The image we present can be stepped over
Could it be that we are like the others long ago
Will we ever learn that all who come must stumble"

All the curtains are drawn and the windows stay closed
She's got pictures and paint that she never used
She's not so much angry as hurt and confused

When her husband comes home after working so late
They both try to be strong for the other one's sake
And they talk about things that don't matter at all
And neither one mentions what's right down the hall

In the room where a cradle holds nothing but questions
And the rocking chair waits in the dark
Where the laughter is silent and the silence is louder
Than even the cries of their heart
Though their faith is strong and they still believe
In what only the Lord can do
They hold to each other and wait for the day
When they can finally go in the room

Though is seems like that have everything in their life
They're not mother and dad, but still husband and wife
As they live with the pain and conceal all the scars
They're close to each other, but they're never too far

From the room where a cradle holds nothing but questions
And the rocking chair waits in the dark
Where the laughter is silent and the silence is louder
Than even the cries of their heart
Though their faith is strong and they still believe
In what only the Lord can do
They hold to each other and they wait for the day
When they can finally go in the room

There's a light in the hallway that's calling
To a place where the dream finds release
In knowing their Heavenly Father is holding the key

To the room where a cradle holds nothing but questions
And the rocking chair waits in the dark
Where the laughter is silent and the silence is louder
Than even the cries of their heart
And though their faith is strong and they still believe
In what only the Lord can do
They'll hold to each other and they'll wait for the day
When they can finally go in the room

The very deepest part
I kept to myself
But your love made me strong
And now my heart belongs 
To no one else
There's no one else

Only you
Can have the part of me
I gave to only you
No one else can love me
Just the way you do
No matter what we go through
Forever I love only you

There's something in your touch
That tells me just how much
You feel inside
You're not afraid to show
How far your love would go
There's no end in sight
So for all my life

Forever, forever
Only you
Can have the part of me

No one else can love me

The stars will all appear 

See there's food for me,

There's gold that's in the air

Hey Ho! I'm finally fed up,
With the run around chase and cut,
So I hung my jersey up,
Turned in my playas card um,

Finally learned how to act and in fact,
Its 'cause of who you are,
So glad that I found you

So glad (so glad) so glad,

So glad baby so glad that I found you,

So glad (so glad) brand new,
So glad baby I'm so glad that I found you

2nd Verse:
Hey you caught me up,
When I stopped you started me up
When a brotha got low got me up,
Can I be up stuck stuck up,


Girl hook me up,
And not to be cliche (cliche),
But I'm the Clyde to your Bonnie (Bonnie),
My good day hey just the way you do,
Makes me so damn glad that I found you

I... didn't want to love you
I... swear to God it's true
I... don't like dreaming of you
But i... but damn my soul, I do.

Y'see, I got hit so hard, I thought I was dyin'
Then I fell so far, I thought I could fly


Darling from the start, if somebody's lying,
Double-cross your heart, and don't even try.

Because i... sure don't want to need you
I...'d hate to count on you
I...'m tired of going crazy, anymore

I was so bored, it should've spilled 
Chicago skyline lit the night 

Cut my nose, bite my face 
Tonight will last forever 
Take my life with your hands 

I laid with you until the end 
Watching the breathe crawl from your bones 
My alibi was lost that night 
So take your last breathe in tonight 
With the frozen sky, surround your eyes

After the VMAs my baby momma cuss my ass out.
I kicked her ass we back friends like Puffy and Steve Stout
Cut the grass around my clique so I could see these sneaks
You see back in the hood it's 'cause I see they fake
I preach a sermon about the paper like I'm creflo dollar
I'll pop you punk niggaz like I pop my collar
I'm confused; I like Megan, Monica, and Mya.
Missy's freaky and Brandy's shy, uh
Now take a look at how my lifestyle changed up.
I'm on now, god damn it I done came up.
Now you could find me with the finest hoes.
Choosin' which whip to drive by what match my clothes.
I got a fetish for the stones, heavy on the ice man
If I ain't gotta pistol on me, sure I gotta knife man
Get outta line and I'm lightin' your ass up.

So I don't see no seeds
After I'm done you clappin' the crew
Hell yeah, I fuck fans
Guess what your favorite rapper does too
In a minute I'ma have the jeweler makin' my rims spin
My crew run wild at the Jamaica's at Kingston
Nothin' but bling bling in ya face boy
That's why my neck shine like one of them shirts Puffy and Mase wore
I done find a nympho as soon as I pop a bra
She had my balls head first just like a soccer star
You can only stand next to the man if you proper
Y'all take care of birds like a animal doctor
Been out and I'm buzzin' niggas just slept on me
So I'm out for revenge like one of bin laden's cousins

But play the game like they rich to me this shit funny
I know you see me comin'
'Cause on the front of the Maybach
It say payback for those who hated on me
I hate when niggas claim they bangin' a gang
You ain't no crip like snoop
You ain't no blood like game
See I've been having beef
I have my own bullet proof vest
Most of my enemies dead I got about two left
Until my last breath I'm sendin' niggas bullet holes
Innocent bystanders get hit tryin' to be heroes

Please fasten your seatbelts in the interest of safety
Atlanta welcomes you to come witness the light
What you've been waitin for this fine Saturday night
Yes, that's right, come one, come all
Through the boondocks to all suburban shopping malls
Trailer parks, the PJs, country clubs, and ghettos
This is your Saturday night special

It's Saturday and the club smells like cigarettes and aftershave
Survival of the fittest, we're the last remaining castaways
Crack the stage, tear the roof off and collapse the place
A new breed of emcee with characteristics of a master race
Captivated, you can't recall who those others are
Make you drop to your knees and thank god you paid the cover charge
Love is hard to listen to, 'cause we're softly killing
It's been a long time since you've had feelings this original
Second nature like breathing slow for those like Ishmael
The bases that you need to know, we supply the remedy
Each cypher is a china shop, we break porcelain figurines
The mic is a weapon and you've got suicidal tendencies
Stammer and stutter through your twenty minute train wreck
The 9 to 5 is right here with or without a paycheck
You're like a sure thing, disconnect is a safe bet
Wait a sec, just heard you hit record on your tape deck
Call your local DJ and make him put it on repeat
This song is the reason Americans practice free speech
When The Source has less street cred than Teen Beat
Every weekend shut it down and listen up when we speak

It was love in the club
There's thugs in the club
There's drugs in the club
But it's bugged that the club
Is home for those that ripping like us
We got your hands in the air, yelling while you slapping your vertebrae
Saturday night special like a snub nosed thirty eight
So click, bow! mix six shots for hip-hop
We're goin' state to state with this, so your city is just a pit stop
Or for however long my set is
I'ma rep this from georgia to California to jersey back down to Texas
A real emcee don't rely on marketing the gimmicks
When I told him to stop writing, I was targeting the mimics
So make some noise for me and Manchild and of course there's Dust
Raise your voices up, and enjoy the rush
You can trust that we gonna gonna give you what you came for, and a little bit more
Something for you to spend your change on when it finally hits stores
I might battle before or after the show or after I flow
We gonna know that I'm official like the tag in the store, yeah

(ManCHILD)
I'm passing this accurate round forth and back radical sound
It's me and greed the time for action is now

Smacking clowns and think you're backin us down
You bound to get it first
We keep it fresh like your mouth after chewin some Cinnaburst

(ManCHILD)
Yeah I spit a verse I wrote today I can't wait till the ink settles
Bring it through the blinking lights, broken dreams, and drink specials

You think bezzles and chains will define you as an emcee
But if you rhyme after I'm finished shining the club gonna be empty

(ManCHILD)
To put it simply, this is life and living it is on you
Giving y'all the means to be limitless if you want to

But I warn you, this is a about as real as it gets
To make it in this takes patience like dealing with kids

(ManCHILD)
Right, and I can't spare the rod because effectively we change the pace
Save the face of music on weekends plus the labor days

In a major way this is the way we play the game
So say the name, issues with Mars Ill still spitting these waves of flames

(ManCHILD)
We chain gang bound together breaking what surrounds me
Maybe some day you'll be blessed to find our presence in your county

Putting you down for the bounty to collect this, so check this
This is hip-hop music don't ever disrespect it"

I don't know when,

When it falls into place

We go from if to when

Are both behind

She is everything I want that I never knew I needed

And let's get high as a kite
And have safe sex

Somebody say sex (sex)
Say safe sex (safe sex)
I love it (I love it)
I need it (I need it)

But for real, when you're havin' sex
No matter what type, make sure you wear the latex
To all of the cons out there sexin'
Stop and look, boy, you're stressed out protection
Cause aids is real and something to believe
Or not make-believe and fake like hair weave
A death wish like Charles Bronson
And if you don't believe me then ask Magic Johnson
About the sex"

Of every rolling ocean wave
Who will stop at nothing
Loving those He came to save
Who is worshipped by a chorus
Filled with morning stars
And listens to the whispers
Of all the lonely hearts

Who is the world
Can birth creation just by speaking
Who but the Lord
Deserves our praises just by being
In all of Heaven and in Earth
Can we find another who is more worthy
Who is the world
Delivers us by interceding
Who gave His word
To bring salvation by believing
In all of Heaven and in Earth
Can we find another who is more worthy
Who in the world, who in the world

Would you believe
He separated sea from land
Yet stops to etch the fingerprints
Upon a baby's hand
Would you believe the mighty God
Who made the galaxy
Would condescend to be a friend
And love someone like me

Who is the world
Can birth creation just by speaking
Who but the Lord
Deserves our praises just by being
In all of Heaven and in Earth
Can we find another who is more worthy
Who is the world
Delivers us by interceding
Who gave His word
To bring salvation by believing
In all of Heaven and in Earth
Can we find another who is more worthy
Who in the world but Jesus
The Savior of the world

Who is the Lord over all creation
Jesus, Jesus is
Who is the King over every nation
Jesus, Jesus is
Who is the Rock of our salvation
Jesus, Jesus is
What is our reason for celebration
Jesus, Jesus lives

Who is the world
Can birth creation just by speaking
(Jesus, Jesus)
Who but the Lord
Deserves our praises just by being
In all of Heaven and in Earth
Can we find another who is more worthy

Where are you tonight?
Now my mind is craving
Energy to fly through a darker side of love
(Never lets me fall)
Where are you tonight?
Are you still the one who brought me to the light?
There is nothing else to know
Now my words are gone

Make my bodyfly-fly bodyfly fly high
Make my bodyfly-fly bodyfly fly high
Make my bodyfly-fly reach for the sky-y-y (2)

Needing you tonight
As I am walking through the desert of your eyes
Let addiction be my rope to get away from here
Come to me tonight
Now my body is craving power to survive to make sorrow disappear and
Drift
In ecstasy

Make my bodyfly-fly bodyfly fly high
Make my bodyfly-fly bodyfly fly high
Make my bodyfly-fly reach for the sky-y -y (2)

Make my bodyfly-fly bodyfly, fly high
Make my bodyfly-fly bodyfly, fly high (8)

Hoo-yeah

Take me up-fly-y-y-y
Pick my body up
Take me up

Ya git solitude and ya mix with sanctuary and silence,

Consult my ulcer, it'd be happy to co-operate

Eat your own gun
Scared because my people never known fun

Cops drive down the streets and blow my friends away
I try to smoke enough lah to take my sins away

A truth that's riling

We learn the chokeholds with fishermen's thread
I read The Art of Sun-Tzu in a couple of fuckin' days
Used to practice Kung-Fu with this nigga that's like, double my age
And you can put this on the government's grave
Somebody payin' for the way we have to suffer and slave
Assassination, word up

I hope they get the assassins, I hope that something is done to them
Problem is they're killing them, it reminds me of something like what
Happened to Lincoln

You ain't even safe wit a full clip

Your persona's in question my phosphorescent skin
Makes your heat pistons freeze
I'm a hallucinogen pez-dispenser, led ventures
With a group of umpla-lumpa parachute troopers
Who discredit theories and behead your mentors
Who can radio wave windsurf to invert what is common knowledge
I will insert my solemn promise to style until my limbs burst
Negotiate with marketing consultants, giving me the once-over
Wearing grim smirks
They would like me to convert my gritty edge
To unearth my earning potential
But my face is so sun burnt
Due to all the grassroots grunt work
That I won't be co-opted
And every photo-op needs to be photoshopped cropped and snipped
But I'm a street vendor kinds sir

It's a meat tenderizer at the gallery opening

And I'll tell you what's under the blips of the clean version
Of the infamous rap rant
Trickling down the baggy pant leg
Of this unhappy class aid
Covered in shell fragments of this
Graffiti tagged glass egg
I can sell anything to a hip-hopper
Like it's my cathartic something
But I don't make enough to go apartment hunting

Break out the winter clothes
And find a love to call your own
You - enter you
Your cheeks a shade of pink
And the rest of you in powder blue

Who knows what will be
But I'll make you this guarantee

See
No way November will see our goodbye
When it comes to December it's obvious why
No one wants to be alone at Christmas time

In the dark, on the phone
You tell me the names of your brothers
And your favorite colors
I'm learning you
And when it snows again
We'll take a walk outside
And search the sky
Like children do

I'll say to you
No way November will see our goodbye
When it comes to December it's obvious why
No one wants to be alone at Christmas time

And come January we're frozen inside
Making new resolutions a hundred times
February, won't you be my valentine?
And we'll both be safe 'til St. Patrick's Day

We should take a ride tonight around the town
And look around at all the beautiful houses
Something in the way that blue lights
On the black night can make you feel more
Everybody, it seems to me, just wants to be
Just like you and me

No one wants to be alone at Christmas time
Come January we're frozen inside
Making new resolutions a hundred times
February, won't you be my valentine?

And if our always is all that we gave
And we someday take that away
I'll be alright if it was just 'til
St. Patrick's Day"
1860,TRAFQFM128E078EC97.h5,Eminem,The Way I Am,"Aight, man, whatever...

Spoken:
Dre, just let it run.
Hey yo, turn the beat up a little bit
Hey yo, this song is for anyone... fuck it, just shut up and listen
Hey yo

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences gettin' this stress
That's been eatin' me recently off of this chest

And I rest again peacefully (peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter

To not come and speak to me (speak to me)
I don't know you and no, I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-ing thing
I'm not Mr. *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick

If you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet (10 feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you

Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of arguin' (of arguin)
I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be, it's just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content.
That song ""Guilty Conscience"" has gotten such rotten responses.""

And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinky

Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school

And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see an upper class city

Havin' this happenin' (this happenin' )
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name Is""

And pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
That copped me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)
To deal with these cocky caucasians

Who think, I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?

The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
Till I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (ahhh)
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (me crazy)
I can't take it, I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am

Check it, watch how we do it

(Verse One)
Make way for the kid to come in girl
And let me rock 'cause I love the way you pop that (C'mon)
Every single time we come to drop that
A lot of freaky women react to a nigga hot track (Lets go)
Then we start to cook up the place
Women watching the nigga with the ready to do the (UGH!) look on their face
(C'mon)
Freak nasty, you know the way you do it all on the guard
And the way you love to speak nasty, another freak pass me (WOO!)
Floss on, in the club ain't even got the draws on
You messing with a nigga better, stop that shit mama
In other words you better watch that shit cause you got that shit
The way your ass sit up all on your back
It's like you need to go shop that, see niggas would cock that
And definitely won't waste it
And while you at it take a lick and just taste it (taste it, taste it, taste it)

B-b-baby tell me why tell me so
I'd like you to go high you tell me to go low
So I go low, taste the shit, taste it again I like it
Baby tell me why tell me so
I'd like you to go high you tell me to go low
So I go low, taste the shit, taste it again I like it

Pass the last courvoisier bottle down the at bar
See a chick that kinda look like a star
And I'm saying even though I wanna to take you home girl
I know its kinda late but you ain't got to come along girl (echo)
Wait a sec you know I know a song girl
Me and you and one of your other home girls (echo)
Let me put it down and we started to bone girl
The other had a heat ""I thought y'all be gettin' along girl?"" (echo)
Just put the pep in your step, what's with all the emotional shit
You know we be swingin' a hep
Put it on me like I wouldn't recover
Saying two chicks that was beefin' and touching and feeling each other
Word to mother, now we having a ball
The way we knockin' as the sound of the bed head smackin' the wall
Baby I'm saying I lovin' how you rubbin'
And the way that you lace it and rush it when you gettin' ready to taste it
Baby I love it, the way you rub it
And the way you lace it and rush it when you gettin' ready to taste it

Ladies! If you want your man to get down and
(Taste it, taste it, taste it)
Just throw your hands in the air, fella's just make it do it too
(Taste it, taste it, taste it)
Now you can both do it

(Verse Three)
Shorty hit me all on the two-way
Tell me to meet her way in the back by the couches up inside the cheetah
Then I step up in the club keep it moving wit' my hand on my heater
Stay alert and never moving the sleeper
Even though this shit was way off the meter
Couldn't believe her
Shorty buggin' and giving me head in back of the speaker
Now check it, I love the way she step to it and how she's keepin' it basic
And always be ready to taste it

The sphinx
I designed a pyramid so tough that a star
That only glows every one hundred years falls
Into the center giving divine perfect light
I am bad

I sat on the throne
Drinking nectar with allah
I got hot and sent an ice age to Europe
To cool my thirst
My oldest daughter is nefertiti
The tears from my birth pains
Created the nile
I am a beautiful woman

I gazed on the forest and burned
Out the sahara desert
With a packet of goat's meat
And a change of clothes
I crossed it in two hours
I am a gazelle so swift
So swift you can't catch me

For a birthday present when he was three
I gave my son hannibal an elephant
He gave me rome for mother's day
My strength flows ever on

My son noah built new/ark and
I stood proudly at the helm
As we sailed on a soft summer day
I turned myself into myself and was
Jesus
Men intone my loving name
All praises All praises
I am the one who would save

I sowed diamonds in my back yard
My bowels deliver uranium
The filings from my fingernails are
Semi-precious jewels
On a trip north
I caught a cold and blew
My nose giving oil to the arab world
I am so hip even my errors are correct
I sailed west to reach east and had to round off
The earth as I went
The hair from my head thinned and gold was laid
Across three continents

I am so perfect so divine so ethereal so surreal
I cannot be comprehended except by my permission

I mean... I... can fly
Like a bird in the sky..."

And we refuse to see
That people overseas suffer just like we

Scenes from all romantic prose while tethered to the roles
Or what was meant disguised as sentiment could hang
Misunderstood and left unanswered

Haunted as I hold you
Nervous slacking with the lacking heartache
No heartbreak when I told you

And though I never did surrender could you please remember
If and when we meet again we once were more than friends
Embarrassed me but would you share a scene and kiss me
One last time before I leave you

And though I won't surrender I want you to remember
If and when we meet again we'll still be more than friends
Grant me this it could seem frivolous, but kiss me
One last time before I leave you

You've got all my loving in a tangle
That I could never undo
You will never hear me singing la la

1896,TRAIPAC128F9320FAA.h5,Grace Gale,La Matanza,"I see you standing over there alone.

Crying on the telephone.

I'm sure its safe to say you've seen your better days...

You must have heard what everyone said,

But don't you let it go to your head.

The backseat is just a luxury you could not afford.

Because everyone has figured you out...

So think before you open your mouth...

The next words you say could incriminate and leave a chance for them to burn you at the stake.
So sit back and relax, chew up the scenery.

Let the people see what you wanted them to believe.

Because I don't care if you sink or if your ship wrecks,

I will only assume it was because of me...

So don't hold your breath...

(An apology is not something I would expect)

Don't take that step

(Don't cross that line there might not be anything left)

You might lower your standards for a night or two.

Your best excuse is there was nothing left to do.

You were so desperate and dried out that one kiss is all it took to ignite the fuse...
Now that I've got your attention.

With a simple slide of hand and the honest intention to,

To make you fall.

Here's to the idea of living through it all...

So quiet now...

Don't say a word...

This will all be over soon if I don't get my medicine.

Then you can phone the doctor and tell him what a mess I've been...

As you wake up on the bathroom floor nothing could've mattered more than finding your way back home...

So brush your knees and quietly leave, don't promise me you won't promise me anything...

(An apology is not something I would accept) expect...

An apology is not something I could do."

As the evening sky grew dark
She looked at him and he felt a spark
Tingle to his bones
'Twas then he felt alone
And wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate

They walked alone by the old canal
A little confused, I remember well
And stopped into a strange hotel
With a neon burning bright
He felt the heat of the night
Hit him like a freight-
Train moving with a simple twist of fate

A saxophone someplace far off played
As she was walking on by the arcade
As the light bust through a beat up shade
Where he was waking up
She dropped a coin into the cup
Of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate

He woke up; the room was bare
He didn't see her anywhere
He told himself he didn't care
Pushed the window open wide
Felt an emptiness inside
To which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate

He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks
Where the sailors all come in
Maybe she'll pick him out again
How long must he wait
One more time for a simple twist of fate

People tell me it's a sin
To know and feel too much within
I still believe she was my twin
But I lost the ring
She was born in spring
But I was born too late
Blame it on a simple twist of fate"

Supposed to last forever
So why do promises just simply fly away

And left me alone and crying
I still believe that love will come along one day

I'm not exactly sure where I should start
But I still believe with all my soul and heart
When it tells me...

Somewhere
Just beyond the reach of my arms
You're waiting there
Somehow
I'll find my way into your heart

There's a way
Till I find you somewhere

And I've heard it all before

A matter of believing
I can't help wondering
Who those miracles are for

For everyone, it seems
But surely that means everyone but me
Still there's a part of me that's dying

Nigga did whatever it took to get in nigga
From the jackin', to the rappin', to the slangin' crack and...

First Verse:

X-Raided up in this bitch, bout to disrupt some shit,
Ain't from the pound, but I'm still down to Kurupt some shit,
Interrupt your shit, 'cause I'm always in a rush to spit,
Like an axe, when I rap, I splitter up your clique,
You better relax, be a witness or a participant,
Eddie Gaffin' laughin' at the CO, wonder where the Sergeants went,
See we flow, but it's way more bigger than that,
Ransom note, deliver the gats and all them wack ass tracks,
So we slit his throat, it's malicious, but the game's vicious,
And niggas know, we'll do anything that gains us riches,
We quick to flow, but we just as quick to bark that heat,
Start that beef and Dott Dogg will pause that heartbeat,
We hard to beat, like Schwarzanegger in movies bout factual
Burning niggas like third degree,
Critical surgery,
When I'm mad, you hoes burglary, intrudin' your home,
Stole everything like clepto includin' your dome,
Left your ass chewed up, gaze blast, mid-section blew up,
Bet you all five homicide detectives threw up,
Suit up, in coca sacks then I smoke a bag,
They make me get my focus back, then I choke the gat

When it came to gettin' that money I did whatever it took,
Fuck dividin' the power, wanted every cranny and nook,
Understand me nigga, my family is full of thugs and crooks,
Kings and queens protected by knights, bishops, and rooks

Second Verse:

You better look into my eyes, can't you see the pain?
I'm tired of lies, bitches and niggas playin' games,
This is my ghetto prayer, Lord can you hear me?
Protect my family from player haters, don't let 'em near me,
No need to fear me, I'm only human,
Pursuin' dreams for greenbacks with more schemes, than J.R. Ewing,
I mean that sincerely,
Love my alcohol and tetrahydracanebanol dearly,
Consumin' twenty pounds yearly,
Clearly I'm out for the cash, nothin' else in my vision,
Takin' chances, makin' decisions that could keep me in prison,
But circumstances keep demandin' me to break these laws,
Writin' lyrics strong enough to, penetrate these walls,
Dott Dogg, don't feel I'm guilty,
As charged, I'm filthy really,
Down for the cause, and I'm comin' raw till they kill me feel me,
With slugs to the dome, ain't no love so it's on,
And if you ain't thuggin' with me nigga, then I'm thuggin' alone,
I'm a ruggish bone like Bizzy, Wish, Krayzie, Layzie and Flesh
Art of War to the last breath, nigga ride to the death,
We hardcore, Dott Dogg and Nefarious,
Mad man, Black Market till they bury us

Third Verse:

I'm constricted on y'all ass like a python,
I'm ready to spit some venom, turn this mic on,
Run up in em,
Checkin' them niggas like a chess board,
'Cause they be hatin', what'cha think I sport a vest for?
Premeditatin',
Yes Lord I got my eye on'em,
When they try to get me I'ma have a fat surprise for 'em,
Got some advice for 'em,
You better recognize, Raided ain't down for none of that bullshit,
Got a full clip, and this man eater won't hesitate to pull it,
And deliver the bullets to your chest like a mailman droppin' off letters,
Fat hole in your sweater,
Smash out with all your cheddar,
Met a nigga that had much game, deeper than the abyss,
Taught me such thangs as how to get fame and keepin' cash in my fist,
Now I insist to get my scrilla scratch,
How real is that?
And I'm quick to peel a niggas cap,
Is you feelin' that?
Move swiftly when I see the cops, 'cause I ain't scrillin',
Muthafuckas wanna see me drop, but I ain't willin',
You a pawn in my book,
Busta market a hook,
Saw the fear in your eyes the first time that I looked,
I'ma treat y'all niggas like powdered cocaine it's time to get cooked,
I'm Michael Jordan, you the average guard about to get shook"

I feel the world fall from the inside
It's coming down

Although I miss you I would never ever say I do
Bleed like the rain
Like the rain that falls upon my skin

Then you just gave our love away
You just let go

Then you just gave our love away
You just let go (You just let go, you just let go)

Bleed like the rain that falls upon my skin (Bleed like the rain that falls upon my skin)"

que no puedas entender
que eres tú, todo lo que quiero

Cómo caminar sin ti
mendigo, perdido voy
cómo vida mía...

te juro por mi alma
te doy todo lo que soy
eres para mí...

tú eres quien decide, si respiro hoy

Cómo puede ser...
que conmigo seas tan cruel
si por ti, yo me derrito

Sólo de pensar
que sin ti, mi cuerpo iría
sin sentido a la deriva

Cómo caminar sin ti

Eres mi razón,

Si respiro hoy
Si yo respiro hoy

For a fake Chinese rubber plant
In the fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself

It wears her out
It wears her out

She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins

And it wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
It wears

She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run

If I could be who you wanted

You were the one that didn't turn your back

And a Bible in your right hand
You said turn the other cheek
For there's a better world awaiting for the meek
In my mind, these words remain from Reuben James

Faded shirt, weathered brow, calloused hands upon the plow
I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James

Reuben James, one dark cloudy day
They brought you from the field
Unto your lonely pine box came
Just a preacher, me, and the rain
Just to sing one last refrain to Reuben James

Comes remembrance 
Comes the halo 
Comes the flight 

And the ground takes a fall 

Torn upon winds of witchery 
Resplendent wings unfold 
Revelling in lucid lechery 
We invoke what no eye can behold 

Azure, her gaping portal 
I blaze in ecstasy 
The goddess calls, immortal 
Shrugs off all treachery

Wait for evenfall 
For the night to embrace us again 
Wait for evenfall

He saw the sun in the night
He took a top-gun pilot
He made him fly through a hole
Till he grew real old
And he never came down
He just flew till he burst

Time will crawl till our feet grow small
Time will crawl till our tails fall off
Time will crawl till the 21st century lose

Full of white eyed fish
And a drowning man
With no eyes at all
I felt a warm warm breeze
That melted metal and steel
I got a bad migraine
That lasted three long years
And the pills that I took
Made my fingers disappear

Time will crawl, time will crawl
Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose

You were a talented child
You came to live in our town
We never bothered to scream
When your mask went on
We only smelt the gas
As we lay down to sleep

Time will crawl and our eyes fall out
Time will crawl and the streets run red

Ten piedad samaritana de lo amargo de mi ser.

So hand in hand we strolled down lover's lane

She was oh so far from a chunk of ice

Some going down to Stovell wearing trouble on their shirts

I work for the county out on 95
All day I hold a red flag and watch the traffic pass me by
In my head I keep a picture of a pretty little miss
Someday mister, I'm gonna lead a better life than this

Working on the highway, laying down the blacktop
Working on the highway, all day long I don't stop
Working on the highway, blasting through the bedrock
Working on the highway, working on the highway

I met her at a dance down at the union hall
She was standing with her brothers, back up against the wall
Sometimes we'd go walking down the union tracks
One day I looked straight at her and she looked straight back

So I'm working on the highway, laying down the blacktop
Working on the highway, all day long I don't stop
Working on the highway, blasting through the bedrock
Working on the highway, working on the highway

I saved up my money and I put it all away
I went to see her daddy but we didn't have much to say
""Son, can't you see that she's just a little girl?
She don't know nothing about this cruel, cruel world""

We lit out down to Florida, we got along alright
One day her brothers came and got her and they took me in a black and white
The prosecutor kept the promise that he made on that day
And the judge got mad and he put me straight away

I wake up every morning to the work bell clang
Me and the warden go swinging on the Charlotte County road gang

I'm working on the highway, laying down the blacktop
Working on the highway, all day long I don't stop
Working on the highway, blasting through the bedrock
Working on the highway, working on the highway

Working on the highway, laying down the blacktop
Working on the highway, all day long I don't stop
Working on the highway, blasting through the bedrock
Working on the highway, working on the highway"

Quand quelquechose me tomba dessus
Je mis mon doigt c'était de la fiente
Ah merde les pigeons m'ont déçu !
Me nettoyant je fis un grand geste
Pour enlever ce fard incongru
Une vieille reçut ma main un peu leste
Et tomba au milieu de la rue…

Un pigeon m'a fait d'ssus
Y'a une vieille dans la rue

Ca s'est passé dans la rue de Nantes
La vieille était allongée par terre
Un jeune cycliste de 20 ans ou 30
S'efforçant d'éviter la grand-mère
Fit un virage vers un 38 tonnes
Qui l'aplatit sans faire de manières
Il dérapa en tuant 3 nonnes
Et défonça un grand mur en pierre

Un pigeon m'a fait d'ssus
Y'a une vieille dans la rue
Un cycliste écrasé
Un camion éclaté

Y avait des cris dans la rue de Nantes
Les gens couraient vers le camion fou
Qui dans le zoo avait fait une fente
D'où s'échappaient quelques kangourous
Les marsupiaux tentèrent une ruse
En bondissant vers n'importe où
Le hasard les mena à l'écluse
Mais en sautant bloquèrent les écrous

Un pigeon m'a fait d'ssus
Y'a une vieille dans la rue
Un cycliste écrasé
Un camion éclaté
Des kangourous en fuite
Une écluse toute remplite

Sacré bazar dans la rue de Nantes
L'eau du canal envahit les quais
Elle inonda l'usine attenante
Qui des éponges fabriquait
Là toute imbibées, elles gonflèrent
Les murs autour finirent par céder
Et pas de chance car passait derrière
Tout le Bagad de Lann Bihoué

Un pigeon m'a fait d'ssus
Y'a une vieille dans la rue
Un cycliste écrasé
Un camion éclaté
Des kangourous en fuite
Une écluse toute remplite
Des éponges qui explosent
Le Bagad est morose

Apocalypse dans la rue de Nantes
120 bignous se mettent à sonner
Le son était proche de l'épouvante
Jusque dans le ciel on l'entendait
Désorientée la fusée Ariane
Vint atterrir devant un ramier
Qui s'envola et que Dieu le damne
Revint sur moi se soulager

Un pigeon m'a fait d'ssus
Y'a une vieille dans la rue
Un cycliste écrasé
Un camion éclaté
Des kangourous en fuite
Une écluse toute remplite
Des éponges qui explosent
Le Bagad est morose
Une fusée qui se croûte
Les pigeons me dégoûte
J'en ai marre des pigeons
Je déteste les pigeons
Et je hais les pigeons
Oui je hais les pigeons !!!"

I've tasted its pleasures
I've known some love

In the livin' I've done

Along in numbers of one

One 5th Avenue

There's only one Mona Lisa
One Leaning Tower Of Pisa
One Paris and there's only one you

I've been a king
And I've been a pauper
And everything there is in between

It took some time
To know what is timeless
But I've found and
Learned what that means

I'll never leave you, girl
'Cause I know the catch
The wonders of this world
Will never come with a match

A brand new emptiness inside
I wish that I could fill the space
It's not my place to take the place

She's been hurt and she's been lost before
This loss has her alone once more
Even though my girl's alone
She stays together strong as stone

She stops my rain, she calms my storm
Miracles she can perform
I've seen tough times, she's seen me through
And always knew just what to do

So many rely on her, I'm one of them and I know it
When demons haunt inside of her she fights hard not to show it

I've seen my girl forced to take
Pain, tragedy, and much heartache
The tears she hides, the smile she fakes
And through it all, she doesn't break

I don't know where she finds the strength
I'm only glad that she can
Just when I think my girl is down
She's on her feet again

She stops my rain, she calms my storm
Miracles she can perform
I've seen tough times, she's seen me through
And always knew just what to do

So many rely on her, I'm one of them and I know it
When demons haunt inside of her she fights hard not to show it

I've seen her world before my eyes
Get filled with evil, painful, spiteful lies
Still she fights, still she tries
And she will fight until she dies

Demons haunt inside of her
Demons haunt inside of her
Demons haunt inside of her
Still she fights and still she tries
Demons haunt inside of her
She will fight until she dies"

Your gold hit sound dumb
Hold it now, crown 'em

Got 'em 'round town
Could've drowned in it
Woulda floated bloated, voted sugar coated
Loaded hip shooter

Draw for the poor
Free coffee at the banks
sip through the straw
None more for me, thanks

That blanks the raw
That dank sure stank lit
Sank passed the pit
For more hardcore prank spit

Crank it on blast
Roll past Front Street
Blew the whole spot
Like some old ass with skunk meat

These kids is too fast
Juiced off of junk treat
Who could get looser off a crunk or a funk beat?

My guess is yes you can like, can I kick it? wicked
Liquor shot, if you happy and you know it
As you clap your hands to the thick snot of a poet flowin'

Broke a pen and I'm in cope hymen
Doperhyming all worth it then
The hope diamond
Acquired off the black market
Or wire tappin' couldn't target a jar split
The rapid fire spark lit

A rapper bug zapper
And it don't matter after
If they's a thug or a dapper

Plug yer trap or it's maximum exposure
The beast got family members asking 'em for closure

Aw, send 'em a gun an tell em clean it
Then go get the nun who said her son didn't mean it
She wore a filled-in thong, a billabong
And said, nah, fo'realla, the villain on a Gorilla jawn?

A veces resulta y muchas otras veces no.
Nos hicimos tantas cosas sucias sin razón
Y fue inevitable, nos rompimos el corazón.

Pero la mañana llega igual
La gente arranca temprano,
Algunos mas otros menos
Es la ley de la vida, no se puede parar.

Todos fuimos puestos en la ruta del dolor,
Bicho que camina va a parar al asador.
Fuimos dos extraños así fue como empezó
Dimos tantas vueltas y al final no se quien sos.

Vamos a meternos en el mar,
La luna pega en el agua, hace calor en la playa
Vas surfeando las olas que el destino te da.

Y aunque hoy perdimos la señal
Así es la ley de la vida, es una ruleta rusa
Hecha de cal y de arena, de principio y final.
Cada día mas confusión, una escandalosa prisión
Una jungla sin compasión, hecha de misterio y traición.

Nos clavamos los puñales nena, por detrás,
Dejalo que sangre! Lo mejor es olvidar.
Sacate la careta baby, ya no actuemos más
Lo que cura enserio las heridas es amar y cantar.

Esta es la tierra del oro y el sol,
Sangre, camino, desierto y calor.
Entre tu karma y la ley del talión
Asi es la ley de la vida mi amor

Ya se que no soy Tiberio gemelo ni vos Calígula,
Pero no te paso a buscar nunca más con un Cadillac,
Ni los sueños nena, fuimos casi hermanos
Después pasaron mas de dos mil años
Y hoy otra vez estamos en aquel mismo lugar."

Love can take a turn
When you least expect it to
Me and you, me and you oh oh

Love can run faster than you can
Love can run faster than you can

Take what you get
Till you get what you want
Don't settle for
What you know to be wrong
When you've run out of time
For a feeling
You've gotten used to believing in

Love can run faster than you can

Fall for what replaces
The things you were leading to
Love can take a turn
When you least expect it to
Me and you, me and you oh oh

Love can run faster than you can
Love can run faster than you can

Do you admit regret in times of doubt? (We will think for you.)
A life of gun in hand, with a dedication to your land,
Inside out you've shown it's not what life's all about.
No, we cannot believe in what you said,
When your whole life's been a sacrifice mislead.
But we still hold the pride.
When the gun smoke clears, we'll still salute you.
When you return by the tide, we'll be here to see your life through.
I'm confused and punctured. My conscience is my only means of direction.
Did I sign up for suicide, or a saddened bride?
Three more years, no white picket fencing, suffering a mental conviction.
Please, don't you think that now we will look down
On a man who's realized what's true to him now?
It's not giving up, it's seeing what else there's to see.
When you're soon set free, there is so much more than a camouflaged hell.
So cock the gun and fire into the eyes of a great desire.
A fleeting destiny has turned into what's considered to be normal.
And I'm here for you."

I can see right through
That hole inside
You listen to rock and roll
Believe in other gods
If I think about it baby
We're totally at odds

When you're close to me
Something stirs in me
Oh, the beast is free
But I know you'll never be

Why do I always chase the ones that run
Why do I always chase the ones that run

He is a friend of mine
We dine from time to time
We drink and smoke and then
I take a six-train home again
I need time to pretend
That he didn't touch me at all"

You clicked your heels and wished for me

Through playful lips made of yarn

Unraveled words like moths upon old scarves

Vivienne Westwood can't go wrong, mixed up with second-hand clothes

I tell my heart I'm better off without him now

Fall apart

Waking to the after-taste
Of cheap wine and bad decisions
My heart trembles in this morning glare
I could shield my eyes
From these inner most seductions
But still somehow you'll find me there
And why don't we say what we really feel?

Whenever things are at their best...

Whenever things are at their best...
Why do we wait for it to fall apart?

I'm not the world safest bet
I've never been too good at being good

But everything you say I oppose
I blame it on my hole

Funky fuckers

Erick Sermon:
Y'alll guess what the fuck is going on now
Me and Reggie Noble, making funk tunes around the global
Cause times keeps on slippin', and I get the funk from the kitchen
Then commits to ass whippin', there is no time for me to bust it
So I'm a chill and let Red get into a fly poetic justice

Redman:
Yo, it's all in the mind and I'm high and I kick it for the do or die
On 2 or 1 area code leavin' shit blown
Funkadelic is the one to bring the preacher out the teacher
When I feak 'em, ooh, yes y'all I got the mad method can you catch it?
And if your ear is not tuned in then ajust it

Erick Sermon:
Breaker 1-9, breaker 1-9 representin' today
Hey, Erick Sermons on the way
Dre gave me a ride so I Gangsta Lean while DRS will put the smoke in my
Chest
And if you understand me then escape and kick it
While the E-Double gets wicked with your brain twisted
It's going down, it's going way down
Go get the 4 pound and boogie down

Redman:
Boogie woogie to boogie to band boogie to that
My rap get mad dap on ass cracks and F it be on my ass cap
Cause my funk rolls thicker than Bisquick
If it's mixed with that same funky sticky shit I roll my splifs with
I shot the sheriff on the terris
And I kick the funk like these to have more off days than Ferris
Just wrote these raps up in the studio
Brothers can't tell and sisters can't hear me no (hear me hoe)

E got the funk, Red got the funk, Red got the funk, E got the funk (x2)

Erick Sermon:
Someone's knockin' at my door, yo Johnny Gill, I need the whole floor
So I can get busy remember? And if you don't call Michael Jackson
And don' be afraid to ask him, Erick Sermon got mad tunes
No matter what they say, I got more props than Richard Bay
The mind bogglin' with the hardcore followin'
So what's up, 'cause I don't give a fuck

Redman:
Whoa, I make you sing with Tony Braxton
I tear the shreads out of jams like stadiums when they packed in
Back up boy you messin' with the rude bwoy yes I told ya
I rock leather jacks with Tims, sweatpants one leg rolled up
Hold up! This is a stick up, I spark the izm with ? like a bizcut
1 and 2 skirts get lift up, E got the funk and Red got the funk
Pop the trunk, I get blocks of funk to make victims say ""That's the one!""
Of coarse I'm funky like fat people having intercorse
Basically the funk is stuck in your teeth so get the dental floss
Oh oh, freak out, 20 I know
But let me knock your teeth out
When I was young I turned my tree house into a weed house
And I'm deeper than Nostradomis, when I'm in chronic
And I leave your kitty cats meowin' home made bondage (meow)

Pönäkästi koplaansa ohjaa

ja ponteva Paavo pokkaa

Hurreja pari voi sekaan laittaa
Ei se tahtia yhtään haittaa

Tehtäessä hallitus pohjaa
Ja jos kansa hieman muutella miehiä aikoo

Kiltisti kaikki tottelee
Kun johtaja jotain määrää
Jussi hieman joskus ottelee
ja joukossa Paavo häärää
Mutta jos johtaja piiskaa käyttää
Joka ainoa käskyt täyttää
Muita vain joskus tölväisten
Seittejä joukko kutoo
Sitä onnenpäivää ootellen
Kun pallilta pomo putoo
Kiusalla johtaja senkun nuortuu
Ja sen ryhti ja selkä suortuu

Tässä on kopla, ja kummisetä

But I glanced at that old roadmap and she just didn't make the grade
There wasn't nothing wrong with her lovin'
She just ain't got what they got down in Biloxi
I got a doll in Pascadola I got a jewel in Gulf Port
And both of them more warm blooded that any woman I've made up north
And it's a cajun queen in Creole she must be six feet tall
When she starts lovin' now you just gonna climb up the wall
Ain't nothin' against the other states they just ain't got what they got down in Biloxi

When I reach the city limits I'm gonna stop upon the bluff
Nonchalantly get naked and go swimming in the gulf
Wash the north all off of me when I feel like it's done
I'm gonna crawl up on a rock and soak up all that southern sun
The sun shines in Minnesota but it don't shine like it do down in Biloxi
Then I'm going to missing persons I'm gonna turn my body in
And beg the police to shoot me if I try to leave again
Cause friend I've been all over and even looking at it from the worst
It's still stands out as bein' about the finest place on earth

For brains and planning and organized thinking
But I'm sure the women are equal
And they may be ahead of the men

Yet I wouldn't spread such a rumor around
'Cause one organizes the other
And sometimes the most lost and wasted
Attract the most balanced and sane

And the wild and the reckless
Take up with the clocked and the timed
And the mixture is all of us
And we're still mixing

But never, never, never
Never could have it been done
If the women hadn't entered into the deal
Like she came along to me

And all creeds and kinds and colors
Of us are blending
Till I suppose ten million years from now
We'll all be just alike

Same color, same size
Working together
And maybe we'll have all of the fascists out of the way by then
Maybe so

Never could have it been done

She's looking for me somewhere, I know
She's looking for me high and looking low
Oh, to live and die, it seems
Is a waste without a dream
She's looking for, she's looking for me somewhere

She's looking for me somewhere, I know
She's looking for me high and looking low
Oh, to live and die, it seems
Is a waste without a dream
She's looking for, she's looking for me somewhere

And as the morning sun begins to rise
Alone, I go to bed and I close my eyes
And I Dream about a girl
Out there in the world
She's looking for, she's looking for me somewhere
She's looking for, she's looking for me somewhere"

Based on Psalm 95:7-8, Hebrews 3:13

Don't let your heart be hardened - don't let your love grow cold
May it always stay so childlike - may it never grow too old
Don't let your heart be hardened - may you always know the cure
Keep it broken before Jesus, keep it thankful, meek, and pure

May it always feel compassion - may it beat as one with God's
May it never be contrary - may it never be at odds
May it always be forgiving - may it never know conceit
May it always be encouraged - may it never know defeat

May your heart be always open - never satisfied with right
May your heat be filled with courage and strengthened with all might

Let His love rain down upon you
Breaking up your fallow ground
Let it lossen all the binding
Till only tenderness is found"

Rien n'efface les douleurs d'hier
Sans toi je n'aurais
Jamais pleuré autant de joie pour personne
Le canon qui résonne

Ici sur pilotis
Refuge de mes amours englouties
Mon cœur d'éponge à la dérive
Les marées ne me feront revenir
Je reste avec
Les étoiles de mer
Les oiseaux des terres amères
Et mon cœur qui se perd

Je suis tombé pour elle
Je n'ai d'yeux que pour elle
Ma maison, ma Tour Eiffel
Quand mes amours prennent l'eau
L'île aux oiseaux

Au-dessus des marées
J'ai de l'amour à perpétuité
Pour Pyla sur mer, Arguin, Ferret
La pointe aux chevaux de mer, l'été
Arcachon, Piquey et Frédéliand
Les glaces sur la jetée
Pourraient bien me manquer

C'est ma tour de Babel
Mon phare, ma citadelle
Mon cinéma, mon repère
Mon oasis et mes amours à la poubelle
Et quitte à perdre pied"

Goodnight, ladies all around
But the right one hadn't found me such a bad night
I didn't feel right

Asked me if I'd like you as a double date
My stars above, I fell in love

With the queen of the roller derby

Yeah, the queen of the roller derby

Now Queenie's a lady, she's quite a child
Oh, she'll make you feel fine
Remember the time when a trucker from Dallas
Was callous to Queenie with his rude side

Now he can't deny, that he gotten much more, than balled before
Queenie's right across, running to the floor
Now he knows better than to mate

With the queen of the roller derby

Oh, as fast as a bullet, she can jam all night
Makes a full grown wonder bull die with fright

Feel your mouth kissing me again,

We walked through the ice floes
To an unenduring land
Our future, our hope
There was something in the air,
The Age of the Unknown
Far beyond the sea of trees
The vision laid close

There's a place where the sun shines brighter
There's a mountain that climbs to the stars...

Day and night we built a reign
With heavenly desire
Sweat and dreams made up the bricks
That raised up our walls

Paying tribute to the gods
And blood kept on flowing
And the lust for knowledge
Was the sense of it all

Fly, fly to the stars,
Reach them on high
Bring back the answers of the night
Roll with the clouds,
Sing with the birds,
'Cause one day we'll have to say goodbye!

Here we go, carrying no longer sorrow
Standing up in the wind
Walk along, marching on for tomorrow
In this neverending way

Many years of harmony
The message arrived soon
Three big stars lined up together
A chill in the air...

The high-priest was dressed in black
On top of the stairways
Longing for the sacrifice
Of those who would dare

Fly, fly to the stars
Then let it fall
Into the emptiness of night
Our time has come
Time to move on
'Cause one day we have to say goodbye...

Here we go, carrying no longer sorrow
Standing up in the wind
Walk along, marching on for tomorrow
In this neverending way

Come with me to Paradise
Let's return again,
Let's return again!

To be closer to the skies
Living on a dream,
Living on a dream...

Here we go, carrying no longer sorrow
Standing up in the wind
Walk along, marching on for tomorrow
In this neverending way"

Spoken:
Dre, just let it run.
Hey yo, turn the beat up a little bit
Hey yo, this song is for anyone... fuck it, just shut up and listen
Hey yo

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences gettin' this stress
That's been eatin' me recently off of this chest

And I rest again peacefully (peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter

To not come and speak to me (speak to me)
I don't know you and no, I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-ing thing
I'm not Mr. *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick

If you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet (10 feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you

Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of arguin' (of arguin)
I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be, it's just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content.
That song ""Guilty Conscience"" has gotten such rotten responses.""

And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinky

Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school

And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see an upper class city

Havin' this happenin' (this happenin' )
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name Is""

And pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
That copped me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)
To deal with these cocky caucasians

Who think, I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?

The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
Till I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (ahhh)
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (me crazy)
I can't take it, I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am

For something better
There's nothing better
Same old weird and familiar sound
It's just you leaving town, my God
August came around

Summer comes and
Leaves you with a fever
That you caught
When you were young
Summer goes, makes you feel
Like life is great
And hanging on for more

Empty streets, empty me
Just call me vagabond
Wondering in the sun
This is getting sort of old
Wandering aimlessly
Is it empty streets, or empty me?

Summer comes and
Leaves you with a fever
That you caught
When you were young
Summer goes, makes you feel
Like life is great

And hanging on for more

Hanging, hanging
Holding on for more, hoping, praying,
This will all start over
Come back for me
We will walk the streets
Of this old town
Make me a promise
This will all come back around

Summer comes and goes and leaves you
(You wanted more)
It comes and goes and leaves you

Summer comes and
Leaves you with a fever
That you caught
When you were young
Summer goes, makes you feel
Like life is great
And hanging on for more.

Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out for you

I'm just so fuckin' depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump, but I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps, fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up in order for me to pick the mic back up

I don't know how or why or when, I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm startin' to feel distant again, so I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet

And I know some shit's so hard to swallow, but I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact, I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow, but you'd have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

I think I'm startin' to lose my sense of humor, everything's so tense and gloom I
Almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room, just as soon as I
Walk in, it's like all eyes on me and so I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that, then it opens the door for conversation, like I want that

I'm not lookin' for extra attention, I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room, maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant, tryin' to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack and half of 'em ain't even funny like ""Hah!

Marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, Goddamn!""
Unfortunately I am, I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down, listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

In my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see, what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

Nobody asked for life to deal us, with these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves and flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now I could have either just sat on my ass and pissed an' moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in and get up and get my own

I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
Or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in, in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid, even if it meant actin' stupid

Aunt Edna always told me, ""Keep makin' that face, it'll get stuck like that""
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there, holdin' my tongue tryin' to talk like this
Till I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then 'cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no more

But I already told you my whole life story, not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where your sittin' it's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each others' shoes at least
What size you wear, I wear 10's, let's see if you can fit your feet

In my shoes just to see what it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own. (Oh)
Everybody has their private world, where they can be alone. (So)
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through? (Oh)
Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out for you. (So)

Spoken
Yeah, to my babies, stay strong. Dad'll be home soon.
And to the rest of the world, God gave you them shoes, to fit you.
So put 'em on and wear 'em.
Be yourself, man. Be proud of who you are.
Even if it sounds corny, don't ever let no one tell you you ain't beautiful. (So)"

But windin' up with no one is a lot less fun, than a burn from the sun,

Parce que tu es mon dieu
Je crois que toi, tu t'arranges
Pour que notre ciel soit bleu
Je veux bien tout croire
Tout ce que tu me dis
Quelle belle histoire
Celle de notre vie

Je crois qu'il y a des anges
Quand tu me tiens contre toi
Je crois qu'il y a des anges
Quand tu m'écrases dans tes bras
Rien n'existe plus
Que le bonheur d'aimer
Notre amour éperdu
Frôle l'éternité !"
2164,TRAQRFN128F93071EA.h5,Carolyn Arends,Last Thursday (Call Me Crazy),"I think it was last Thursday - I went to see my friend
We drank some Coca-Cola, we laughed a while and then
We dove into philosophy and politics and sin
The way we do
He told me he'd been looking the cold truth in the eyes
He told me my religion was wishing in disguise
He said ""The only Savior is the one inside your mind""
And I said ""if that's true
Then you can

Call me crazy 'cause I don't want to live that way
Call me lazy - I don't want to work that hard
Call me crazy, but I don't think that I can save myself

You see I've read a thousand pages on how to help myself
To a thousand different ways to perfect mental health
And I swear I've tried them all and I'm still needing something else
And I think you are too
So you can

Call me crazy 'cause I don't want to live that way
Call me lazy - I don't want to work that hard
Call me crazy, but I don't think that I can save myself

And furthermore I still believe in what I cannot see or touch
Crazy things like dreams and prayers and faith and hope and love
And I know a life without these things is not a life at all
So you can call it sanity but then you'll have to call me crazy

Call me crazy 'cause I don't want to live that way
Call me lazy - I don't want to work that hard
Call me crazy, but I don't think that I can save myself"

Supondo talvez me enganar
Mas que tanta crueza
Se em mim a certeza é maior do que tudo o que há
Todas as vezes que eu sonho
É você que me rouba a justeza do sono
É você quem invade bem sonso e covarde
As noites que eu tento dormir meio em paz
Sei que mais cedo ou mais tarde
Vou ter que expulsar todo o mal 
Que você me rogou
Custe o que me custar 
Vou desanuviar toda a dor que você me causou
Eu vou me redimir e existir, mas sem ter que ouvir
As mentiras mais loucas 
Que alguém já pregou nesse mundo pra mim
Sei que ao meu coração só lhe resta escolher

This was the last time

That he'd touch her
That he'd make his little girl

In Eden leading seeping
And I don't wanna rock the pump

Rolling wid my bucks in the biggest snatch shit

Smoking up bud and fucking up blunts

Wid the nines and beams the philly and green
Wid a clik tight team and a nigga like me

You ask I answer no, that seat's been removed
You're a deep-rooted tree, an artist's muse
I watch you listen, and I watch you share
You make me want more
And you make me scared
You're so much more than I'd ever hoped

Oh won't you breathe
Breathe me in
So I am whole

Oh won't you breathe

An autumn season in a summer's time
And I watch you circle
And baby I watch you fall
You make me feel what I thought
I could never feel at all
And you're so much more
Than I'd ever hoped

I lament her beauty,
Her voice a sour note
In this bitter serenade.

And all these WORDS I could have would have should have said
Ring out like gunshots across long lost days.
If this wasn't love then what the fuck was I thinking?
I would bear my soul
Just to bask in your grace
And your beauty.
Your strength inspires all of my days.
I would carry any load
Just to bear your cross for one day...

GO!

In this perfection I
Lament her beauty,
Her voice a sour note
In this bitter serenade.
In this perfection
I lament her beauty,
Her voice a sour note
In this bitter serenade.

Your love fills me up
When the blood in my body has drained
And your strength is my backbone when I feel every bone break...

&lt;&lt;Whispers: I felt the pain,
I sweared to let no one in
And there you were
A vision of beauty
It takes my breath away
You took my breath away.
And it takes my breath away.
How you took my breath away.
And it takes my breath away...
Thou took my breath away...
And it takes my breath away... you took my breath away &gt;&gt;

How could I know that you would take my breath away?!
And how could I know one kiss would change everything?...

It was written on the walls and window shades
And how she'd act the little girl
A deceiver don't believe her, that's her trade

Sometimes a bottle of perfume
Flowers and maybe some lace
Men brought louise 10 cent trinkets
The intentions were easily traced
And everybody knew at times she cried
But women like louise well they get by

Everybody thought it kinda sad
When they found louise in her room
They'd all put her down below their kind
Still some cried when she died this afternoon

Louise rode home on the mail train
Somewhere to the south I heard them say
Too bad it ended so ugly
Too bad she had to go this way
But the wind is blowing cold tonight
Goodnight louise goodnight
Goodnight louise goodnight"

I can't attempt to put a name upon his face
Empty eyes I see the demon
If I could I would leave this place

Another wave to crash around me
A pulling current that could bring me to my knees
Where was I during the beating
Separation of body mind and...

Part of me doesn't even care
Part of me wasn't even there

I can still see his face
The lines upon his face
And if could erase the hate
That breeds this nightmare

The ladies start to bounce as soon as I hit the club
But in the midwest, they love to take it slow
So when I hit that shit I watch 'em get it on the floor

And if you need it hyphy, I take it to the Bay
'Frisco to Sac-Town, they do it any day
Compton to Hollywood as soon as I hit L.A.
I'm in that low-low, I do it the Cali way

And when I hit the Chi', people say that I'm fly

I'm into drivin' cars, push 'em off the lot
I'm into shutting stores down just so I can shop
If you need a bird, I could get it chopped
Tell me what you need, you know I get 'em by the flock

I call my homie Black, meet me on the ave
I hit Wash Heights with the money in the bag
We into big spinners, see my pimpin' never dragged
Find me wit' different women that you niggas never had

For those who say they know me, know I'm focused on my cream
Playa you come between, you'd better focus on the beam
I keep it so clean, the way you see me lean
And when I say I'm hot my nigga this is what I mean

Ask me what I paid and I say, ""Yeah, I paid a guap.""
And then I hit the switch that take away the top
So chicks around the way they call me cream of the crop

They hop in the car, I tell them, ""All aboard!""
We hit the studio they say they like the way I record
I gave you black train and I did you wrong
So everytime I see 'em, man, they tell me that's they song

They say I'm the bomb, they love the way the charm
Hanging from the neck and compliments the arm 
Which compliments the ear, then comes the gear
So when I hit the room, the shorties stop and stare

Then niggas start to hate, tearrange their face
But little do they know I keep them things by waist-side
I reply: Nobody gotta die
Similar to Li'l Weezy 'cause I got that fire

The orgied frantically.

Had burned their leadser at the stake;
Soon he'd regret his deed.

Thirst and suffer till he'd choked.

And the soul did feel the roar.

Death to all pity, all prayers.

Your life will never begin.
Cleanse now the scum in your soul.
Out the lies, the lies you've been told.

Look up, don't age with content.
Get strong and go deep within.

Do you know what it feels like
Loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away?
Do you know what it feels like
To be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed?

If birds flying south is a sign of changes
At least you can predict this every year
Love, you never know the minute it ends suddenly
I can't get it to speak
Maybe finding all the things it took to save us
I could fix the pain that bleeds inside of me
Look in your eyes to see something about me
I'm standing on the edge and I don't know what else to give

Do you know what it feels like
Loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away?
Do you know what it feels like
To be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed?

How can I love you, how can I love you
How can I love you, how can I love you
If you just don't talk to me, babe?

I flow through my act
This question, is she needed?
And decide all the man I can ever be
Looking at the last 3 years like I did
I could never see us ending like this
(Do you know?) Seeing your face no more on my pillow
Is a scene that's never ever happened to me
(Do you know?) But after this episode I don't see
You could never tell the next thing life could be

Bem chumbado, atravessado
Foi por aí cambaleando, se acabando no cordão
Com o reco-reco na mão
Mais tarde o encontrei num café zurrapa
Do largo da Lapa
Folião de raça
Bebendo o quinto copo de cachaça
Voltou às sete horas da manhã, mas só na quarta feira
Cantando ""A jardineira"", ""A jardineira""
Me pediu ainda zonzo um copo d'água com bicarbonato
O meu pedaço estava ruim de fato
Pois caiu na cama e não tirou nem um sapato
Roncou uma semana, despertou mal humorado
Quis brigar comigo, que perigo, mas não ligo
O meu pedaço me domina, me fascina
Ele é o tal
Por isso não levo a mal
Pegou a camisa, a camisa amarela
Botou fogo nela
Gosto dele assim
Passou a brincadeira e ele é pra mim."

The judge was a fishin' buddy that I recognized
I said ""Hey, judge, old buddy, old pal""
""I'll pay ya that hundred I owe ya if you'll get me outta this spot""
So he gave my friends a little fine to pay
He turned around and grinned at me and said
""Ninety days, Jerry, when you hot, you hot""
'N' I said ""Thanks a lot""

When you're hot, you're hot
And when you're not, you're not
He let my friends go free and throwed the book at me
He said ""Well, when you're hot, you're hot""

I said, ""Well I'll tell ya one thing judge, old buddy, old pal
If you wasn't wearin' that black robe I'd take out in back of this courthouse
And I'd try a little bit of your honor on

Como es que todo se ve mejor contigo
Como es que nada parece igual
No puede ser amor, lo que siento en mí
Es mucho más de lo que imaginaba

En un momento el corazon perdí
Sin darme cuenta todo te lo dí
Y en el pecho siento nueva vida
Donde mi corazón dormía

Tú, tú robaste mi corazón
Qué puedo hacer?
Me siento presa de ti
Y no me quiero escapar de tu vida

Tú, tú llegaste a mi corazón
Con tu querer
Con tu alma y tu ser
No te quiero perder, nunca nunca

En un momento has cambiado todo, amigo
Lo que esperaba al fin llegó
Lo que en nadie más pude encontrar
Sin esperar, caí ( cayó* ) en mis manos

How does it feel like this
To be caught in a web of a heavy grip
Where your mind can't believe or try to admit
That the one that you love is a fool you don't realize
When will you finally wake up
And the love that you hold is a taste of bad luck
And all that you have is a bag full of lies
He's blinded you deep by the look in the pit of his eyes

And If I knew that this could be
A total catastrophe
I probably would have told you a little sooner so you wouldn't get hurt
If I could change this possibly
It would be how you want this to be

Cause it ain't over till it's all done
So let me finish my conversation
Yes I'm tryna get your attention
'Cause you're distracted by affection
Can't you see that it isn't true
Love you thought you had and knew
And I've been chosen to tell you
That you're stupid and you know you gotta do it LEAVE!

When you are deep in love
It is hard to see past all the dirt and the mud
You tell everyone that it's great and okay
When you know in your heart
That it hurts and it won't go away
Afraid to let go of the hand
That you held so tight when he said I'm your man
But his eyes seem to sway at the flick of a switch
And you are alone in the dark with a bruised broken heart

And If I knew that this could be
A total catastrophe
I probably would have told you a little sooner so you wouldn't get hurt
If I could change this possibly
It would be how you want this to be

Cause it ain't over till it's done
Listen to my conversation
Yes I'm tryna get your attention
'Cause you're distracted by affection
Can't you see that it isn't true
Love you thought you had and knew
And I've been chosen to tell you
That you're stupid and you know you gotta do it LEAVE!

You know that I do get it right
The truest friend you can't deny
You know that I don't tell a lie
I know that you love him
It's clear that you'll put up a fight
To keep the love still in your life
But I must speak
The truth be told
Even though I know you love him

Cause it ain't over till it's all done
Listen to my conversation
Yes I'm trying to get your attention
'Cause you're distracted by his affections
Can't you see it isn't true
Love you thought you had and knew
And I've been chosen to tell you
That you're stupid and you know you gotta do it do it!
Say what?!

Take a look around and tell me what you see.

Is there something here you might have overlooked.

And it would be a shame if you leave
And find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be.

The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad.
And now you say that you've grown tired
And you want to be by yourself a while.

It would be a shame if you go
And find that freedom was a long time ago

I know you can't stand for chains to bind you
But they just keep on driving us apart.
And you could go where I would never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from you're heart.

So one more time for old times sake
Come and lay your head upon my chest.
Please don't throw this moment away.
We can forget the bad and take the best.

And if you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for old times sake.

To deliverance
I can harness the cosmos in the palm of my hand
Bring the earth to a grinding halt by single silent command
Lay the mountains asunder, turn oceans to dry land
I've found the key that unlocks the shackles of gravity
Stones are floating overhead suspended in perfect symmetry
And the stones they sing to me... whisper soaring melodies
Accept this offering. For the past to be buried. Sustained by longing
Breathe your life into me and cure my disease
Open the window. The center of your chest
Take an axe to the glass. Find a friend and hide
I've built a home for my sweet across the brooding sea
Every cut that I made, I thought of your face
And every stone that was laid made your image cease to fade
But alas I am scorned. Hereby sentenced henceforth to wander
In empty castles
Body is a device to calculate
Soul is the earth trodden under our feet
Mind is the beauty begging to be raped
God is a child tugging on the shirt tails of fate
The snake is charming us
Our voices will ring from skyscrapers down the ley lines
And carry out to sea

And the flowers cover the land
They’ve been waiting patiently
For the right raindrop to set 'em free
Well ain’t it just like love
I thought there was none
That was when I found one
On a dark night in a southern town
You called to me and I turned around
In a perfect moment when the stars aligned
You couldn’t have come at a better time
And every day in my life had led me to
That perfect moment with you

Lucky that we did not meet
Ten years back on the street
So many pages yet to turn
So many dreams still to burn
Oh but I don’t cry for the wasted years
Or the twisted roads that got me here
I have been to the end of the earth
And I know what standing still is worth
In a perfect moment when the stars aligned
Love don’t travel in straight lines
And every day of my life had led me to
That perfect moment with you

Well the wheel of fortune is going round and round
I never thought I would come up when I was down

But a perfect moment when the stars aligned
When you put your hand in mine
And every day of my life has led me to
That perfect moment
Every day of my life has led me to
This perfect moment with you"

Ever since the world began it's been that way
For man and woman were created to make love their destiny
Then why should true love be so complicated? Oh

To see someone in such a stew for me
And when you say you'll do all you could for me
It's so good for me it's bad for me

I felt till you whispered to me
Completely left on the shelf
But since you started to woo me
I'm just crazy about myself

It's a boon for me a break for me
To hear that your heart's on the make for me
Yet no matter however appealing
I still have a feeling it's bad for me

All the lies, broken truth, they don't understand
Mesmerized by the world if they only knew
You kept your soul in a place that was safe for you

What will you say
When the angels come for you
What will you say
On judgment day

Don't want to live without you
You are my world, you are my life
Don't wanna be without you
On judgment day

Touch your heart, take it out, so they all can see
Now exposed to the fate of your misery
I'll sedate all the fears that you say are true
Now exposed to the ones that don't care for you

What will you say
When the angels come for you
What will you say
On judgment day

Don't want to live without you
You are my world, you are my life
Don't wanna be without you

And though the tiny lights were dim
I could see the love light shining in her eyes
With aching heart and trembling hand

I thought of things that might have been

She smiled and it was more than I could bare

How could he know the way I feel

Doomtree crew
Rhymesayers crew

In a world where the world ends at the end of your block
And them, uh, little whirlwinds spin friction 'round the clock
I be savage, hunt and gather the average rather cadaver
Cock back hammer, splatter matter all over cell phone and calendar

No peace, yeah, in the middle of a war zone
Riddle when the norm thinks slow
No sleep, yeah, with the shades down low
On the down low fighting with a dream
I creep, yeah, all my secrets please
I don't need to speak
I'm paranoid like a man in the land of the free
To set up and let us burn turn cheek

Damn, stop like the octagon top of your block
I'm gone off my rock, no songs, no more locked
Just a little bit of prison sneakin' up on us
We won't listen till there isn't any more of us
These days we quick to part ways with rights, like, okay here
But let's be clear, for the record, I did not sign up for lockdown
Or any kind of shock and awe now, I'm so bored

You must have forgot just who you were dealing with
Nothing less than aggression
So naked, so crystal clear, with a trust
In absolutely fucking nothing but Doomtree
Step up your thought game lames, we all thirsty

It's like they leave us no option
Walkin' these streets here just watching
These preachers speak from their pockets
These teachers, bring it back
These teachers reach but can't stop it
Seedlings so poisoned, so lost
Just following prophets to nonsense
Tossin' what's right to the dust

And I ain't no casualty
Got no surface with spotless morality
My dirt might have to cover up my grave
But I keep my fear of faith and filth clutter up my cave
Got me lookin' for my disinfectant
I don't know how to behave, God I'm bored

You must have forgot just who you were dealing with
Nothing less than aggression
So naked, so crystal clear, with a trust
In absolutely fucking nothing but Doomtree
Step up your thought game lames, we all thirsty

So thirsty for more"

It'll never be over, will it?

Crawl across the floor
If it feels like something you know
Curl up in a ball
If it feels like home

Sleep as much as you can
If you can't sleep then lay there
Pick at yourself
Until you feel pure

Something's pulling you to the floor
Like a long-time friend
Someone's banging your head on the wall
As a means to an end

This must be the end of you
But you know this will never stop
You can't hear anything anymore
Just the hammer in your chest

Walk on through the growing noise
Of your inescapable path
Walk willingly into the dark
Nothing can touch you now

Empty
Empty
Empty
Filling up with sick

Like water in your lungs
Sucking yellow fog around your head

Once you were a child
The world was darker then
Fear was in the hall
But you won't think about that now

Just some warmth and a home
And an end to the task
Your doors are standing wide open
But it's too late for you now

Something's pulling you to the floor
Like a longtime friend
Someone's banging your head on the wall
As a means to an end

Empty
Empty
Empty
Filling up with sick

Ammonia in your blood
Burning plastic wound around your hand

Lord, I am tired
Look at yourself
Lord, I am tired
What a day this is
Lord, I am tired
Look at yourself
What a day this is
Sometimes I wonder if you really understand

And although it's not quite the time
Although we've just begun to leave
We will tarry not to say we were wrong
To leave behind the silent reproach
And when our eyes are searching out
And our hearts are beating strong
We'll have a reason not to grieve
With holly leaves and scanning skies
And if the colors fade into night
And the storms our heads enclose
And our souls are set against one another
If the seas receive us not
And the skies mock our lowliness
Then we shall still love one another
For we are two, together
For we are two, together

Lord, I am tired
Look at yourself
Lord, I am tired
What a day this is
Lord, I am tired
Look at yourself
What a day this is
Sometimes I wonder if you really understand"

In a strawberry Range, pie crust piping on the cheesecake seats
I'm known for hittin' women's soft spots
With Princess cut Canaries the size of lemon cough drops

(Paul Cain)
I'm right behind 'em in the Porsche drop
Linen soft top, sick chain with 20 point rocks
Take your bitch, why wouldn't I?
The whip got chrome shoes, cream leather seats with old wooden sides

(Fabolous)
Uh, yeah, what's really poppin', usually boys know
This ghetto superstar with the Bruce Lee-roy glow
Niggas has to hate the outcome (yeah)
Plus I'm in a throwback from the same year they assassinated Malcolm

(Paul Cain)
Make so much ends, I got to find faster ways to count 'em (yeah)
A minute on the block, how fast I make a thousand? (Cain)
That nigga you love to hate, still hug blocks and bubble weight
Off the love I can't

And why wouldn't this thing be on my side?)
Why wouldn't this game have you on your knees?
Why wouldn't these 20's be on the V's?
(Why wouldn't this money make you want to hate?)
Why wouldn't I what?

(Paul Cain)
Why wouldn't I pull up to the spot, yellow is all (ok)
Dressed in yellow linen, covered in Canaries never a flaw (uh huh)
Why shouldn't I wear this much ice
The Princesses in my hair, are clear and cut, right?
Why wouldn't I talk this slick (why not?)
With a watch and bracelet this flooded, and a cross this sick?
So why wouldn't I get it homes (I mean)
To a nigga gettin' money like myself, a little brain that's minimal (yeah)
Might talk but I live it though, sick chain glitter roll
Never sleep and don't stop gettin' that

(Fabolous)
Uh, hold up Cain, uh, why wouldn't I have samples of raw (uh huh)
And academic sample the laws (uh huh)
Hypnotic samples the poor (woo)
The European sample is all (yeah)
Will on the right side do with the wings stamped on the door
It's the street family boss, I land by the shores
Get pampered by whores, eat scampy and claws
The kid's been trampeled before by a tramp with no flaws
That's up to they get cramps in they jaws
I keep kefs jammed in the four
Amp meter draw, end up in a wheelchair rammed by your dog

(Fabolous)
After a million scanned on it (yeah)
Why wouldn't the Range look like it got 20-inch ceiling fans on it (woo)
Only reason you in my face ma'am
Is 'cause I got the same mic/mike stat Jordan had on the ""Space Jam""

(Paul Cain)
Why wouldn't I chase chips
Come through Aves, like ""Pluto Nash"" in Coupes that look like spaceships
Ridiculous bracelet and the outrageous
Watch with flawless rocks, invisible placement

(Fabolous)
Uh, I oughta feel like a boss (uh huh)
Why wouldn't I get a 100 an appearance, quarter mil a endorse
I oughta feel some remorse
'Cause I'm killin' 'em out there, and a stick shift sport utility Porsche

(Paul Cain)
Yeah, I know when you see us, it be pissin' you off
Cause you would think we paid a fortune for the shit that we floss
Spend summers in my Sicily loft
Whole crib, interior decoration done by Christian Dior
(Baby girl), I got cops that's on the payroll
Jet skies, and speed boats docked up in Barbados

(Fabolous)
Green and cream Tims, brocolli and potatoes
Why wouldn't you see the Storm for the rocks and these tornadoes"

Paranoia builds this foundation of life
Forever till a change of times

They've killed the devil with undying affection
As he spoke with peaceful phrases before his dying breath
An unattained peace within his self before this death
For a handful of misbelievers of a no man's faith
When good made evil

Alarms triggering, in the back of your mind
Cracks streamline the walls of an empty skull
Prying into the sky

Behold, a circumstance untold of misconceptions
That lead to contradictions
Hi-fidelity of wrong proportions
That spiral into white noise

All obedience disruled... through a visual trap
Cast your stones... closet of skeletons
One to many broken bones

Hiding lies
A costly fear
Question all
Question its reason

An ecstasy you didn't reach... now empty for you

This glimpse of terror
A sight so unsound
An ecstasy you didn't reach

A blind mirror... no reflection... the real world

The furthest one has been
All this time is wasted
Standing on these actions
A quick jolt to reality

These mind terrorist invading a black sand beach
Extinguish a scene of this unleveled conflict
This lapse in time
Turn the page of life
This blame for pain
Been left behind

You acted like things never happen
A stab with simple little phrases
This action of serpent words
It's now your fear they're tasting"

(Verse One: Lyrics Born)
Girl, I know that look when I see it
I know that I can make it work girl, believe it
There's big things 'bout to happen to you now, just release it
I'm like a hunter that searches for your finest weakness (Listen!)
'Cause I take my time, and I bait the line
Then I creep like a lion, till the prey is mine
Can ya taste it?
They way I slip it and give it to you little by little
And minute by minute till it's mixed in your system like venomous liquid
It gets so addicted, you're feeling so twisted
You can't live without a hit of it... I'm so wicked
Live it

(Chorus: Joyo Velarde)
Fiendin', schemin', stealin'
Losing it oveeeeeerrrr youuuu
I've been cryin', lyin'
Doin' it all fooooorrr youuuu
Schemin', pleadin', theivin'

I do it over and over and over and over and over againnn
I do it over and over and over and over and over againnn

I don't, know who, I am, anymore, anymore, anymorrree
I don't, know who, I am, anymore, anymore, anymorrree

(Verse Two: Lyrics Born)
I'm flowin', through your veins
And I'm floatin', through your dreams
Holdin', like a leash
And I won't let, you release
I'm always, on your brain
In the mornin', you awake
Till the moment, you're asleep
I'm holdin', all the strings
You're acting so beside yourself
You know you're fat like (?) can't even recognize you girl
I can't believe you let me in your life
And you can't believe you're so hypnotised
You do anything, say anything, prove anything, praise anything
Sell anything, give anything, steal anything, risk anything
Kill anything, bank anything, anything that the women do for me

Your beauty and the gentle magic of your soul live here in my memory
Golden evenings in pink white veils
Sounds of the river telling ancient tales
Dreams return me to you,
Fire flows in deep blue

Oh Nubia Nubia Nubia, the ringing in my ear
As I wander through another life in search of someone soft and sweet I once held near
Time glances the other way,
Life’s sweet shadow makes night his day
Brings me closer to you,
Paints my heart a deep blue

Whispers of eternity
Bridges life’s sweet mystery
To sleep I go and hear the name
Nubia Nubia Nubia Nubia...

Soft heart wait another day,
Flaming boat will take you away
Then at the mystery’s end,
I won’t have to pretend, 'tend, 'tend

Now, you are at the journey's end, now
All kind of gold at rainbow's end, now
Now, you are at the journey's end, now (hear)

DMX, Limp Bizkit, Sheryl Crow amongst many
Yo, just before I got on stage this chick came on to me
She offered me sumthin
It looked kinda strange, it was in a bag
I said ""Yo, girl let me talk to you real quick""
Yo

I don't sniff cocaine 'cause it mess up my brain
For sexual stimulation I never did no ecstasy
I don't pop pills, I never did no LSD
But I wouldn't mind a kiss from Ms. Mary
'Cause

She's homegrown and you can hold her in her backyard
She's homegrown and you can get a kiss in her backyard

I remember when I was a young boy
I waited for my grandad, ""So daddy can I get a puff?""
He looked at me, he says ""Son, man, you're too young kid""
""When you get older now and you understand that""
""I let you get one kiss from Ms. Mary""
'Cause

She's homegrown and you can grow her in her backyard
She's homegrown and you can hold her in her backyard
If she allows you to you can roll her up
She's homegrown and you can kiss her in her backyard
She's homegrown - I like to be with you Ms. Mary - in your backyard

That's when she looked at me and she said
""Wyclef this' what I want you to do son""

Come on
Inhale - exhale
Exhale - inhale
Inhale - exhale
Now hold it now
Inhale - exhale
Inhale - exhale
Exhale - inhale
Now breath in my face

Marijuan' Marijuan'

She said that
She's homegrown and you can grow her in her backyard
She's homegrown, she said ""'Clef, I'll kiss you in my backyard""
And my daddy don't need to know
She said that
I'm homegrown and you can grow me in your backyard
I'm homegrown and you don't need to worry for my backyard

That's when I said, ""I'ma get in trouble, I gotta go girl""
This' what she said
Laa la-laa laa laa, strictly la-la, to take me higher, and higher {2X}
Laa la-laa laa laa, strictly la-la, to take me higher

I'm about to take it higher {4X - in the background}

Come on y'all, come on y'all, come on
Yo, I want for everybody sleeping on my guitar skills
It's about to beat on right about now
Turn my guitar up yo!

What up Jimi Hendrix, I'll see you baby
Yo, Carlos Santana, thanks for the lessons baby
Yo, Steve Rod, I ain't forgettin you man
To the godfather B.B. King
And to my man Eric Clapton
I think I'm forgettin somebody, man

Blinded I run down these paths
By heart I know them
They lead to the soaring cliffs
Stout they stand above the water's edge
Lifeless

And this is my foundation
Cold stone
Formed only by winds and time
How invulnerable
Lifeless

Ah...
I have longed to be at one with this
Yet, the waters call my name

For once I wish to see
The entity behind the voice
The face of this seduction
The beauty of my pain

Am I blessed or am I cursed by thy presence?
What is my crime?
What is my deed?
Is this life my redemption?
Shall I repent or proceed?

I hate my flesh
Its dimension poisoned my soul with doubt
It made me question the essence of...
The 'I'

Slaves are those of this world
Given freedom to lay the chains upon The Master
The wolf is no longer free
Release the chains and come for me

Suddenly, his mournful cries were stunned.
Out of the cold mist came three enthralling ships.
Sails torn by many a storm, and the bows adorned by the
Most fierce gargoyles he'd ever laid eyes upon. Yet, the
Crew they bore... Three times twelve in numbers. They
Stood motionless, wrapped in grey, worn gowns.
And from behind their shadowed faces the seductive chanting.
Bidding him on board. without hesitation, he accepted.
And away they sailed...

Upon these seas
Wherein I drowned so many times
I scatter the ashes of destiny
Still my flame is in hunger

With fire in my heart
Shall I greet the shores ahead
Though, I know not what will burn...

Desire...

Ah...
In the distance
I hear the waves wash over solid ground
And in this moment I am struck blind

Grant me sight so I can see
That which lies ahead of me
Cursed be my mortal eyes
For dying in this realm of death

Hear my call...

I return to the soaring cliffs
They truly shine of strength
Even though I nothing learned
With strength I burn..."

His way or no way, totalitarian
He's got no time for you looking or breathing how he don't want you to
So step out the queue, he makes examples of you
And there's naught you can say
Behind they go through to the bit where you pay
And you realize then that it's finally the time
To walk back past ten thousand eyes in the line

And you can swap jumpers and make another move
Instilled in your brain you've got something to prove
To all the smirking faces and the boys in black
Why can't they be pleasant? Why can't they have a laugh?
He's got his hand in your chest, he wants to give you a duff
Well, secretly I think they want you all to kick off
They want arms flying everywhere and bottles as well
It's just something to talk about, a story to tell you

Well, I'm so glad they turned us all away, we'll put it down to fate
I said a thousand million things that I could never say this morning
Got too deep but how deep is too deep?

Well, this town's a different town today
Said this town's a different town to what it was last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday
And that girl's a different girl today
Said that girl's a different girl to who you kissed last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday

Seems like he wouldn't be a snake
Or wouldn't disguises come in all sizes and shapes

They all catch the vapes

Took a little time before the D-E-L could see through
The mask all I had to do is ask the heather wall Akwame
And my man responded they would bomb a
Fraudulent foe with the strength of Hercules
The way ya on my dick must really hurt ya knees
You need to take heed and quit being such a groupie
Ever since I did a little show in Guadeloupee
I neva saw a groupie like you
But what is funny is ya wanted to be down with my crew
But D-E-L is not down with any clowns or jesters
So I would suggest that ya try to impress Uncle Fester

You's a thug for sure, I want ice cold ice, hit me off
Wanna break me off, you gotta break me off
Break me off

However you wanna get down
I can get down, baby, like you get down
You know I don't play around
If you got diamonds, maybe we can get down
However you wanna get down
I can get down, baby, like you get down
You know I don't play around
If you got diamonds, maybe we can get down, get down

Can I live? Let me live, you want me
Then you gotta give
I'm a bad girl, such a bad girl
Not a hot girl, but a rock girl
Drive a drop girl
Hair is done, body's right
You wanna touch 'cause I'm just that tight
We can roll, we can stroll but I gotta let you know
I ain't giving out without doe


So if you wanna get with me
Then diamonds is what I need
You are what I need
And if you want to make me happy
Then give me some of your cream
Give it to me baby, give it to me, give it to me

Major Coin, meaning high costing bitch
Only a baller in fact can keep me in the minks
To the small of my back, I'm just keeping it real
Letting y'all know from the gate, no papes, no scrapes
You ain't hungry for it, no plates
Mother fucker you'll get clowned first
Treat you like a corner scrub slinging an ounce of dirt
Think about it, what sound worse?
Telling my Coins you broke, or you drowned the purse?
See only official bitches wifey of a rich nigga
A smart bitch, fuck with no trick niggas
Them grimy bitches fuck with stick niggas
And a dumb bitch just fuck you for your dick nigga"

That he would grow to be this sexy man
But I just couldn't see
'Cause I had my blinders on
I was in my zone
And I had the thought of us in my head
Somehow I turned us all off
And then I met him, and he wasn't you
Then I dropped my head thinkin' what should I do
Oh I

I loved you, and
You love me
And I just couldn't see tomorrow, baby
And I cared for you
And I didn't see us through
Now I know in my heart you will always be
The greatest x ever...

Now I can't do a simple thing like fall asleep
'Cause I can't close my eyes
Without a day with you in my dreams, dreams
Sometimes I call you phone just to hear you tone
And I never say nothin'
Wait just a couple of seconds to hear you breathe
And then I'm gone
But he's not like you
Can't hel but to hold my head
Thinkin' what did I do
Oh I

I loved you, and
You love me
And I just couldn't see tomorrow, baby
And I cared for you
And I didn't see us through
Now I know in my heart you will always be
The greatest x ever...

And I know that it's all my fault
And it would be a lie if I said you didn't cross my mind at all
How do I erase from my days that's shaded and blue
All my luv's with you

I loved you, and
You love me

Can I know which one I've lost

Am I losing love, can I give enough
Am I losing love, I'm losing you

Is there something you can't tell me
Is there something you can't say
Does it hurt you when I touch him

Is laced with life, it's all right.
The feeling remains even after the glitter fades.

The time is faced by a country man
While his heart breaks.
But the dream keeps coming even when you forget to feel

Show all the world how to get along,
Peace will enter when hate is gone.

I lay awake night and ponder world troubles.
My answer is always the same.
That unless men put an end to all of this,
Hate will put the world in a flame, (oh) what a shame.
Just because I'm in misery.
I'm not begging for no sympathy.
But if it's not asking too much,
Just send me someone to love.

Before our eyes it dies.
As far as the eye can see: only destruction.

Crying out for a change.
What can be done?

Each day, we slip further away.
On the edge of ruin.

It won't be long before we succumb.

Are we too late to save ourselves?
We're living in, in a dead world.

It's so cold, and with no joy, we must save Ourselves.

The people, pretended

Storm forth with the light of the inflamed
Reclaim and ignite the sky
Brightly to blind
Rip off the veneers enabling opportunists to thrive
Dam the rise of grime and rats

More sickening than a social circle that believes itself charmed
Are the writhing droves of blowhards and yes men
Clamoring to slither in
Stay sovereign on the outside

The unaffected
Contrasting the wide and white
We are who finish last
Sound
Indignant
The iron to gleaming teeth
The salt on saccharin

Proudly in their darkness
Lit from within

Glad hands grabbing for brass rings
Painting their bricks gold
Keen sycophants filthy scheming
Furthering the feuds of their adored
They have picked their enemies impeccably
Very keen indeed

And so siege the scorned

We are naught but beds of thorns and dark horses
Unwelcome guests who will just not mind their place
A single musket ball to pierce and lodge inside
And lead the circle to crack

We cast no shadow
The stars do not shine here
No genuine light to be found
Only rays of cold, synthetic beams on a mock aristocracy
So the vain and insecure can feel revered and cared for
For a cheap, fleeting moment

You can't kill what will not die
Go!

The world within reach
A promise to myself sealed with anguish
That no matter how hard I fall,
I will always stand up stronger
Harder-a bigger man unleashing pain

There's nothing between us

But you have no idea
The horrors that I've seen
I'll scratch out my eyes
To close the gates to my inner soul

These are the days of the open hand
They will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers

This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand
With ignorance and legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much
But we'll take our chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score

I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
Turned his back and all God's children
Crept out the back door

And it's hard to love
There's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of

And the wounded skies above
Say it's much, much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for time

Do, do, do, oh
Mmm, woah yeah

These are the days of the empty hand
Oh you hold on to what you can
And charity
Is a coat you wear twice a year

This is the year of the guilty man
Your television takes a stand
And you find
That what was over there is over here

So you scream from behind your door
Say what's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much
But I'll take my chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score

And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That He can't come back
'Cause He has no children to come back for

It's hard to love
There's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of

And the wounded skies above
Say it's much too late
So maybe we should all be praying for time

The sun has dissappeared.
It shines for the high ones
That dwell amongst the clouds.
Hidden from the land at the edge
Of the world.
Hidden from the people once so proud.

Meldoria, a people sick of greed.
Meldoria, punished for their deeds.

During the last generations
They've turned their gods their backs.
Now they live in darkness
As the sky has turned black.

Greed and megalomania
Carried them away in blindness.
Throwing all ideologies and morals away
For egoism and carelessness.

Let you be guided by history,
Learn from your mistake.
Don't forget the high one's majesty,
Do not let your great ego awake.

As the holy powers withdrew their support
Great plauge infested the land.
The earth shook and ruined the world,
Seawaves threw up and drowned the land.

Only a few survived the disasters,
Left to breed a new generation.
Stand strong against the greed,
Do not give in for the evil powers
Of evolution."

Yesterday, I found out about you
Even though I'm just looking at you
Feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said, ""yes""

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no
Baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But, do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said, ""yes""

Before you go
Tell me this
Was it worth it
Was she worth this?
No, no, no, no, no

Oh, how could I forget holding her in my arms?

Was all you ever needed
Oh it used to be enough

Was a promise we would give our lives to keep
And no river ran as deep

In the desk where next to your chair's the handle to your door
Dismantle the door handle, put the parts into your desk drawer
Say some words then make a sign, now open up the drawer:
The drawer can't tell you more
Than to deal with the door

Now you object to objects actually meaning more
Than some pathetic, lame aesthetic stolling rone is famous for
Push the drawer closed, grab a firehose, point it at the door
Get it all wet, remember, forget what rock &amp; roll is for
The drawer can't tell you more
Than to deal with the door

Now you're fishing for a mission way beyond the door
First you dream, next you're scheming, searching through your drawer
For an oar for your trip bound for yet uncharted shores
Over-reaching, find me spieling, cataloging doors
The door's a symbol for
These objects in your drawer"

 Insospechado
 Rutas, pasajes y elipses
 Entrelazados

 Dejamos todo atrás
 Quedamos desenraizados
 Armarnos será nuevo
 De nuevo aquí parados

 Aire, humo, entramos a escena
 Cuento los pasos
 Damos la cuenta
 Suenan los palos, las cosas truenan
 Tactos en danza sensual
 Nos acarician las venas.

 Vuelo, viajo...

 La nula expresión
 De algo simple encerrado
 Guardado con llave
 Y secretos impensados
 Objetos cercanos, nubes viajeras
 Hablando sin voz, pensando en la letra
 Campos de vuelta, ciudad, metrópolis nueva
 Pétalos caen miro arriba
 Balcones poblados
 Buller, bares y whiskies entrelazados
 La punta del hilo, el ojal
 La inocencia atando los cabos,
 Mirando de afuera
 Sintiendo que nada es de más
 Aunque duela."

hän tointui unestaan.
Tahtoi hän kokea voimiaan,
ne liian heikoiks' osoittain.

Aikuistua saanut vielä ei,
ei hallita ukkosta.
Oli pojan ensin nöyrryttävä,
opittava jumalain mahti.

Nyt tunteensa sai, tarttui salamaan,
halki taivaiden viha kaikui!

Nuorukainen pilven päällä ratsastaa.
Liian nuori salamoita kantamaan.
Kulkee yksin kunnian polkuaan.
Voimattomuus taitonsa musertaa.

Hän liikaa uhosi - kirouksen ansaitsi.

Nyt tunteensa sai, tarttui salamaan,
halki taivaiden viha kaikui!

Häväisten hänet karkoitettiin,
pois pilviltä isänsä."

Calling out ""I won't surrender""

Sympathize her pious pleasures
Go down the stairs into the dark again
To feel alive again, and wait for
Real love
Or is it me you're after
Is it time?
Because it's now or never
Real love
Real love forever
Real love
Born of the ball and chain
Into a world sustained with sorrow
Real love
A real touch we speak in
Is it lies.
Or is what we're seeking
Real love
In the eyes
Behold and you'll find the 21st century
Detonate her will and her widowed speech
Buried in the backyard shadow
The rusty coffee tin
That held her mother's first kiss in a
Nameless dream
Fall down the stairs again
To feel alive against tomorrow
Real love
Or is it me you're after
Is it time
'Cause it's now or never
Real love
Real love forever
Is it love
Or just yours to treasure
Real love
Real love
Real love
We never listen
Real love will listen
And tell her of my fortune
Real love is riches
Scratch through the changes
Real love is nameless
So tired and hopeless
Real love is painless
Nobody mentions
We ever move to collect
The solar questions
Demon scorn should not relax
The laws of gravity

A Croydon girl could really hope to find a home

You begin to see the value of your freedom...

The moon is bright in the haze above old Hollywood
And deer look down from the hills
And it's three o'clock in the morning
Pill in hand you can hear his golden surfer boys
Crying out, ""Mummy won't come out of the bathroom!""
And you'd hoped he'd say he's sorry if he hit you
But he's buried in the screenplay of his feature

Screen kiss, one screen kiss
Straight from a film I forget who was in
Screen kiss, one screen kiss
Blue filter lens in a pool of vaseline
But all the rushes look the same
Only there's a movie I wouldn't pay to see again
If it's the one with him in

You and I could be a mile above the earth tremors
Hold to me and we'll climb
You could sneak out while he's sleeping
Suicide in the hills above old Hollywood
Is never gonna change the world
Change the world overnight
Any more than the invention of the six-gun--child--
Any more than the discovery of radium,
Or California tipping in the ocean

Screen kiss, one screen kiss

So he had to set forth

He is the man who travels in the land
Of dragons and magic spells
He rides in the winds of fire and snow
And he rules the forest of elves

A flash in the burning night
Curse of the evil lord
He is fighting for his life for the last time

Of dragons and magic spells
He rides in the winds of fire and snow
And he rules the forest of elves

Oh, such beauty in time
But it's just external
He cannot see the truth with his eyes
So he is bound by a lie

As he gazes at the stars
He will be born again in the sky
When the night turns into a dawn

On the way to the ancient castle of time
He will soon be damned by rage
So that his pride could betray him
When it's time to set him free
The tears in his mind had to be pushed aside
As he walked through the gates
He will never die
'Cause he is truly a Hero in a Dream

Du chlore mais tu n'as pas les idées claires
Du chlore j'aimerais pourtant y voir plus clair
Eclore tes yeux d'un éclair dans le ciel

Headin' for a doll serenade
Taking more than we aughta'
Shakin' off the masquerade

Lonely, she decided to see ya'
Get enough for her on the side
When the heat arrived at the motel
Whole town stayed inside

Some lie for love
Some lie for fame
Some lie for trust
Some lie in vain

Some lie for love
Some lie for gain
But I lie for you
In the pouring rain

Move on up to the Bayou
With the same old set of rules
You get nothin' for nothin'
And that's a fact
When you're tied to the ship of fools

Alice looking over her shoulder
Like a Chinese diplomat
Daring anyone to hold her
With a smile like a Cheshire cat

Some lie for love
Some lie for fame
Some lie for trust
Some lie in vain

Some lie for love
Some lie for gain
But I lie for you
In the pouring rain

Shakin' to a halt on a Voodoo
Second oldest trick in the book
No one does it quite like you do
When you start you can never
Stop... never stop

On my way to a seance
Met a gypsy renegade
Crossed my palm with silver
In my heart put a jagged stake

Some lie for love
Some lie for fame
Some lie for trust
Some lie in vain

Some lie for love
Some lie for gain
But I lie for you
In the pouring rain"

A-first saw the woman that looked so fine

A-well went Timnathy, I can't tell

Samson was the first man the lion attach
He caught the lion and got upon his 'ack
A-written that he killed a man with his
And Sampson had his hand in the lion's jaws

Well, the bees made-a honey in the lion hair

Well, if I had-a, a wicked world
If I had-a, ah Lord, tear this building down

Sewed me tow knot, an' formed a plot
Not many days 'fore Samson was caught
A-bind this hands whilst a-walkin' along
A-looked on the ground and found a lil' jawbone
He moved his arm ropes, a-pop like thread
Dropped those threads free, three thousand were dead

Till they began to wonder about
A-till his wife sat up upon his knee
'A-tell me where your strength lie, if you please?'

Samson's wife she a-talked so fair
Told his wife cut off-a his hair
'Shave my head, clean as your hand
Till I become a natural man!'

All that thought you've given me is conscience I guess
If I were walkin' in your shoes, I wouldn't worry none
While you and your friends are worryin' 'bout me
I'm havin' lots of fun

Countin' flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one
Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me, I've nothin' to do

Last night I dressed in tails, pretended I was on the town
As long as I can dream it's hard to slow this swinger down
So please don't give a thought to me, I'm really doin' fine
You can always find me here and havin' quite a time

Countin' flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one
Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me, I've nothin' to do

It's good to see you, I must go, I know I look a fright
Anyway, my eyes are not accustomed to this light
And my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete
So I must go back to my room and make my day complete

Countin' flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all

Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere

And their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had

I find it hard to tell you
'Cause I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very, very
Mad World

""Jan Wayne, turn those Turntables""
Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday
Made to feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen

Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me, look right through me

And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you

All's lost and there's nothing gained
Your time is through
Chasing a worthless fate
Wasting your mind, rotting inside

All of the dreams for your life now have died
Alien mind, ancestral memories
Released in time
Progress and savagery
Scavenging waste, conquest in space
All of the memories of life gone to waste

First in a line
Heading towards mastery
Why waste your time?
Seeking out clemency
You're left behind
Body and mind
All those before you, just slaves to the grind

So sickened by your process and our pain. 
Plague by the fear of a tomorrow, another day in vein, we can throw all this away.
Trading our sorrow for sin.
We can throw all this away. 
For too long we have starred.
For too long we have fucking stayed so blind to every instinct as you paved the way.
So tomorrow we will take back every year you stole from us, and every night silently desperate and hopeless.
Every dream never realized, and every tear shed from these eyes. 
We will sin and you will suffer.
We will set fire to your machines. 
We will put life back into hearts and you will suffer. 
We will run life through our veins and you will suffer. 
Passion will be found in time, and your world will fall behind us.
Under your dark polluted skies, we may live as the damned. 
But our essence and soul and freedom will unfold.
And only in death shall we see the end. 
For as long as the light of the sun still dances across every sea. 
We will know there is something to live and die for, and we will know every breath to be free."

Cried all through the night

When morning comes

And sent it off in a letter to you
Took some flowers in the spring, made a sweet clover ring
And sent it off in a letter to you
Took a song from the lark - the moon frm the dark
A spark from the sparklin' dew
With a kiss and a hug and a whole lot of love
I sent 'em off in a letter to you

I took the mornin' sun peekin' through the trees
And the dandelion silk tangled in the breeze
I folded 'em up - sealed 'em with a kiss

When I told the people
That I could really fly
They said that little boys
Ain't supposed to lie
Poor little superbird
Sitting on the ground
No zoom, zoom, zoom
When anyone's around

Fly, fly, fly, Superbird
Superbird
While you're young, Superbird
Superbird
There's time enough
To wreck your dreams
Have your fun
Superbird

They said I couldn't
So what did I do then?
I cried myself to sleep
And never tried again
Poor little Superbird
They woke you up too soon
No Santa Clause
Or green cheese on the moon

It skipped my mind for years
At least until tonight
When I tucked the kids in
And I turned out the light
There at the doorway
You'll never guess what I heard
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Superbird

Fly, fly, fly, Superbird
Superbird
While you're young, Superbird
Superbird
There's time enough
To wreck your dreams
Have your fun

Si arrancan mi alma
Sería mejor

Que ya no arda
Que no quiero ser
Ni quiero saber
Nada de esa mujer.

La calle es el lugar
Para esa ingrata

Maldita su suerte
Que no quiero ver
Ni quiero saber
Nada de esa mujer.

Yo siento rencor
Abandonado en un rincón

Dame tu mano
Levántame

I was looking back to see
If she was looking back to see

I'm going to follow everywhere
She had a wiggle when she walk
I wanted her to stop and talk

We ice cold, rap Siberia, North Pole
This ain't rock 'n' roll 'cause the rapper's in control
I'm like a blacksmith, forgin' the mic into gold
The game gets old, when the game gets sold

I spent a lot of time, perusin' the T Dot
Maybe a beats hot, but syllables bleeped out
Many men turn to mice when searchin' for cheese, auk
Pick up these guitars, not negative heat knocks now

I'm like a rangular, angular, rhyme strangler
Bangin' the beats from here to Hallie
And I'm manning a microphone
You best respect Canada in this musical famine
So here's some manna you can't examine

I'm staggerin', drunk amongst style
Offishall like Kardinal, big up to Red Won
Misfit, they put me up in the mix
Zeb Rock, ghetto's comin' with a bag of tricks, sick

Yo, it's over here
It's over here
And we blow the spot
Put your city on the map and it's called the T Dot

Here, it's over here
It's over here
And we blow the spot
Put your city on the map and it's called the T Dot

Oh, oh, oh, you don't know?
Corrup and Whippy, that's east of Toronto

Used to take the Jetta downtown to check the sounds
Of DJ X and mastermindin' the underground
Now I'm grown up but I feel stuck
Hip-hop head forever, tryin' to keep it together

Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
Pressure brain, pressure flowin' on my head like rain
But fame can bring pain
That's why I got game and a rude attitude
That I call Emily M

So you can get the Prozac if you claim to know
That what I'm livin', I break it down like long division
A mathematician with inner vision like Stevie
No wonder, I make a move from one street to Vancouver
Lookin' for philosopher's stone
It's over there, no, it's over here, what?

It's over here
Yo, it's over here
It's over here

Everybody knows it but no one tries to stop it
'Cause she barely even knows him but if she could see inside
Everything is quiet as she waits to tell him who she is

Is this all we get to be absolute

Quiet but I'm sure there is something here
Tell me everything 'cause I want to hear

It's a kiss sits upon on her lips that waits for planes and battle ships
She wants to be a dancer and he has got a picture
On his wall and it's a sailor in a new port every night
Yet man was born to trouble like sparks fly upwards innocent

Is this all we get to be absolute

Quiet but I'm sure there is something here
Tell me everything 'cause I want to hear

Quiet but I'm sure there is something here
Tell me everything 'cause I want to hear

There's a light we can love on the way

And all those who seek it shall find it
A pardon for all who believe
Hope for the hopeless and sight for the blind

To all who've been born in the Spirit
And who share incarnation with Him
Who belong to eternity stranded in time
And weary of struggling with sin

Forget not the hope that's before you
And never stop counting the cost
Remember the hopelessness when you were lost

Au creux de ton oreille, et tout, il te promettra

Still gonna conduct motherfuckin buisness as usual

The thing that until now I only read about
New structure eating up the old
The process we all have this nameless dread about

Cold shoals
Their bloodless arms enfold
The earthen engines moan
Corruption, the feast out in the cold
Everybody leaves this dance alone

Lashed up, clinging to a thing
The nights are drawing in, that there's no doubt about
Wild rapture: the old familiar code
This brute reflex is nothing much to shout about

Pegged out, pulling down the stone
Botched, brave and alone
Fierce lustre blistering the soul
Mourning for those I will never know

Stake out, cops inside a van
To test a theory that the world is credible
My brains boiling in a pan
Tests have shown they prove to be inedible

Own up
The terrifying trees
Will shake the leaves around
Dumbstruck
Starts at every sound
Everybody needs somebody now"

It seems they're destined to keep the other out
Or knock the other down
All they'd have to do is nothing
But maybe sleep a little late
And agree to let the other be
To twist their likely fate

Right now I'm alive, I'm feelin' well
It's my life to live my way
So I'll keep daydreaming away
Who knows, maybe someday it will all come true
And I will get my way
And we will live as one

I'm caught up in a dream
I'm gonna wish for it all
No one is gonna tell me how
No way, this is my dream now
I'm caught up in what seems
Simply impossible
I ain't gonna change a thing
No way, it's my dream

What cannot will be done
For every living thing under the sun
Foggy color foggy race
Just be one big happy face
Among the sea of people
Live among God's creatures sharing love
That was sent down from above
Here to share with one another
Father, brother, sister, mother
Everybody sharing love
Sharing love

I'm caught up in a dream
I'm gonna wish for it all
No one is gonna tell me how
No way, this is my dream now
I'm caught up in what seems
Simply impossible
I ain't gonna change a thing
No way, it's my dream

I close my eyes
And everything will be all right
Here in my fantasy
Living in harmony
Make my dream come alive

I'm caught up in a dream
I'm gonna wish for it all
No one is gonna tell me how
No way, this is my dream now

Or an hour too long
Tell me baby would you wait a bit longer?
I wonder if you would
Or would you be long gone?
Would you be alone, would you be alone

For when we call upon the Lord
We summon all of Heaven

For this will tear those mighty strongholds down
Stay on your knees
For this is where the battle is won
Very soon you'll win the victory

When Daniel faced the lions
For worshipping the Lord
It seemed there was no hope at all
For what would be in store
But when we stand on holy ground
Our smallest prayer is heard
Instead of on our circumstance
Our eyes are on the Lord

Pray on
For you are who the Lord is looking for
Pray on
For this will tear those mighty strongholds down
Stay on your knees
For this is where the battle is won
Very soon you'll win the victory

When your questions go unanswered
And your prayers may seem in vain
They don't seem to make a difference
They don't seem to make a change
Just rest assured God knows your needs
And He hears each time you pray
Your prayers are reaching Heaven
And the answer's on the way

Pray on
For you are who the Lord is looking for
Pray on
Tear the mighty strongholds down
Stay on your knees
For this is where the battle is won
There's no better place for you to be
Then seeking the Father prayerfully
Very soon you'll win the victory

You said ""You should get to bed""
I was waiting at the church door
For the minister to show
I was looking at the new year
You said ""Walk before you crawl""

I was feeling like a loser
You said ""Hey, you've still got me"" 
I was feeling pretty lonely 
You said ""You wanted to be free""
I was looking for a good time
You said ""Let the good times start""
With a quiver of your eyelid
You took on someone else's part

But what about me
I don't really see
How things will improve
If all you want is to stay...

Maybe I'm a little greedy
You said ""Think before you speak""
Sometimes I'm a little seedy
You said ""Everyone is weak""

Is there something I can do?

I never had a clue

But what about me

Going to creep around going to creep into your head

There's a little echo calling
Like a miner trapped inside
If I tell her of this moment
She will in me doubts confide
And she's on me like a blanket
Like a stalk of wilting grass
I'm not sure about her motives
I'm not sure about her past

But my faith is like a bullet
My belief is like a bolt
The only thing that lets me sleep at night
A little carriage of the soul
If it starts a little bleaker
Then the year may yet be gold
Happiness is not for keeping
Happiness is not my goal

But what about me
I don't really see
How things will improve
All you want is to stay loose

Oh what about them 
You play mother hen
To a gaggle of gangling youth
All you want is to stay 
The lights are on in the house tonight
Going to creep around going to creep into your head

I was living through the seconds
My composure was a mess
I was miles from tenderness
It was dark outside, the day it was lying in pieces
Everything is flat and dreary
I couldn't care what's in the news
Television is the blues
Television is hysterical laughter of people

I don't know, it could be me
I'm always asking for more
I keep running 'round in circles
I keep looking for a doorway
I'm going to need two lives
To follow the paths I've been taking"

When the war is over we would be free
He said that we'd have to drive
Those Nazis back to Germany
His vote in the post-war years
Was a steadfast cast for FDR
'Cause he thought that the new deal
Would heal a nation's bleeding heart
A man in his middle years
Shed tears about the economy
He said that the balance of the deficity
Would set us free
He was caught in a fragile state
Cause the Dow had never sunk this far
So he searched for the deliverance
At the bottom of a bottle at a local bar

Channel
Everybody, Everybody wants to be free
But I'm here to tell you

Freedom
Can only be found in the blood of Jesus
Freedom
Can only be known in the love of God
Freedom
Comes to whoever would dare to believe Jesus is
Freedom

A child once spoke of the hour
When school would end and he could play
His freedom waited for him
At the ending of another day
His dream was to get to his home
For a stickball challenge on the avenue
If he could get past the dealer
Selling dope
In the middle of the hall at the grammar school"

A friend to the weak, the smug, the huddled thugs...

A waste of money, it's sad but true
But in the morning it'll feel all right
Chart a course with magnetic strips for our broken hearts

We're screaming towing the line
And disposable by design.

So get lovely lovely lovely my girl
I don't wanna be the one to tell you
The luckiest luckiest luckiest world
Is the on between your eyes
Imagine-magine if we we were thin
In the crown of the conqueror worm
And as time pens down we'll say that we'll always feel this way.

Shock to the heart and away we go
And if you wake up in the morning and it still feels wrong
Then put your money in the sad machines
For bombs, punks and tiger teams

Wear heavy metal pants for the labelin' head
Who can blame it on the band who killed themselves next door
For just another little chance to love a lie
I say they loved a lie.
And we will kick them straight down the line
With a conscience clear of mind.

So get lovely lovely lovely my girl
I don't wanna be the one to tell you
The luckiest luckiest luckiest world
Is the on between your eyes
Imagine-magine if we we were thin
In the torch of the Conqueror Worm
And as time pens down we'll say that we'll always feel this way.
Hey... hey...

Chorus repeat...
In the mouth of the Conqueror Worm
And as time pens down we'll say that we'll always feel this way.

And screw your courage to the hardest part

I couldn't find a friend around
To love me like they do right now
They do right now

I'm dizzy from the shopping mall
I searched for joy but I bought it all
It doesn't help the hunger pain
And a thirst I'd have to drown first to ever satiate

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
At all

When autumn comes
It doesn't ask
It just walks in where it left you last
You never know when it starts
Until there's fog inside the glass around your summer heart

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
At all

I can't be sure that this state of mine
Is not of my own design
I wish there was an over-the-counter test
For loneliness like this

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it

And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is
Something's different
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is

They said, ""Come on, Ma let's go to the cabaret""

Get up and show your old man your black bottom

Now I'm gonna show y'all my black bottom

His woman threw him out in the ice and the snow
And she told him, ""Never ever come back no more""

He said, ""Mister Motherfucker, you know who I am?""

And I kick motherfucking asses like you every day

'Cause Stag put four holes in his motherfucking head

Known to make more money than any bitch in town
Yeah

She struts across the bar, hitching up her skirt
Over to Stagger Lee, she's starting to flirt
Oh, Stagger Lee...

You put on a bad show, oh, don't it show

Still out on those pills
Oh do you remember?

Think it's swell playing Max's Kansas
You're looking bored and you're acting flash
With nothing in your gut, to keep your mouth shut
You better keep your mouth shut, you're in a rut

Still out on those pills
Oh do the sambo

You're four years on, you still look the same
I think it's about time you changed you brain
You're just a pile of shit, you're coming to this
You poor little faggot, you're sealed with a kiss

Kiss me
Ha ha ha ha ha

Think it's swell playing in Japan
When everybody knows Japan is a dishpan
You're just a pile of shit, you're coming to this
You poor little faggot, you're sealed with a kiss

Still out on those pills
Cheap thrills, Anadins, Aspros, anything
You're condemned to eternal bullshit
You're sealed with a kiss

Kiss me

A kiss, a kiss, you're sealed with a kiss
A-looking for a kiss, you're coming to this

You do just about anything
Oh kiss this
Eh boy"

The lonely streets where we embraced
Then you are gone without a trace

Another day goes passing by
I sit alone and wonder why
Sometimes it's hard but I will try
To live my life without you

You're in my heart, and in my dreams
You're everywhere or so it seems
So many times I've heard that song
Hold back the tears and tell you're strong 

Another day goes slowly by
I sit alone and wonder why
I think of you and start to cry
Nothing's the same without you

Another time, another place
The sweetness of our last embrace
What would I give to see your face
Nothing's the same without you

We're staring at all these lights
And I am going blind

Fill all of the Navy yards
With hard working security guards

In Paris on winter nights
Beneath a snowy veil?

para bancarte a un pais tan sanguinario. 
Con una mano encima de la otra, 
y el surco de la guerra en los bolsillos, 
estabas en la foto de familia 
desafiando el aire de los conventillos. 
Ni bueno, ni malo, ni sueño prestado 
lejos del lirismo afila el cuchillo 
para cortar en dos la luna llena 
y alimentar al mundo de posguerra.
Y una noche de julio en medio del campo 
al borde de un camino empantanado 
se aparecio el demonio y lo corriste 
con la estampita de San Cayetano. 
Fundaste un sindicato clandestino 
hecho de sudor y de destierro 
Perón los hizo suyos y argentinos 
con una mano dulce como el hierro. 

Ni bueno, ni malo, amor siciliano 
dolce farniente, vendeta caliente 
buscando el sueño de la juventud 
te convertiste en un fantasma, a plena luz."

Don't need an invitation to be reconciled
Cause these home fires are burning

You spent your time making excuses
For the ways of life that you are choosing

How could something so right turn out so wrong?
Not sure exactly where I am

The more we organize we suck out this life
That serves as the fuel behind
You wanna take the passion in my veins
And put it down in black &amp; white

You've got your foot directly on the gas
I watch you burn out so fast
Now I can see just what you've become

Mitä mielessä liikkuikaan
Silti minä tiedän sen ikuisen kaipauksen
Niitä tunteita minäkin tunnen
Hetken tuulet ehti häntä kuljettaa
Vähän aikaa oli vapaa, piti ilmojen valtikkaa
Ja sitten ihan kuin yllättäin
Kai hän lensi pilviin

Of the foolish few who knew them
Then led them to the shame

But nobody told his mistress
She was pushing forty-four

I don't want to know
Where we're heading for
We don't have long to go
We'll hear footsteps in the dawn
'Cause it's just some sort of
Crazy ride we're on


The queen she knows the exit
She's been there once or twice
Whe her saviour got ostricized
For selling free advice

And her knight in shining armour
Comes sliding through the door
Sporting suggestive glances
At all the dancers on the floor

Well I dreamt all those lonely people
I knew them by their names
But their faces lost their identity
In the fury of the flames

They talked in foreign riddles
Lik actors on a stage
But when the word came they were standing scared
Lost in a doomed age"

This dumb brick wall ain't heard a word that I've said
I'm buried alive in the blues

I'm buried alive, buried alive in the blues
I'm buried alive, buried alive in the blues

I beg for mercy, I pray for rain
I be used to be the one to accept all this blame
Somebody here's trying to pollute my brain
I'm buried alive in the blues

All you people, you could cruise on by
You couldn't make me laugh, couldn't make me cry
It ain't no use 'cause you know I
I'm buried alive in the blues

Buried alive
I'm buried alive
Buried alive in the blues

Got boxed off from my easy ride
I'm buried alive in the blues

All you people, you could cruise on by
You couldn't make me laugh, couldn't make me cry
It ain't no use 'cause you know I
I'm buried alive in the blues

Buried alive
I'm buried alive
Buried alive in the blues

Buried alive
I'm buried alive
Buried alive in the blues

When you're buried alieve
When you're buried alieve
When you're buried alieve - oh yeah
When you're buried alieve - oh yeah
When you're buried alieve - it's a bad condition
When you're buried alieve - worse than jail
When you're buried alieve - it's a sad situation
When you're buried alieve - 'cause there ain't no bail
When you're buried alieve - you scream at the top of your lungs
When you're buried alieve - and nobody hears
When you're buried alieve - you can try to reach out for someone
When you're buried alieve - that someone is never there
When you're buried alieve
When you're buried alieve
When you're buried alieve

Didn? have a care in the world, got by day by day
Struggled with the plans we'de made who was I anyway

Workin?on both night and day, in a famous rock and roll cafe
Never thought I'd meet a girl for me
Never thought I'd meet a girl called Cerilene

Cerilene, the road of life is dark without you and I, I just can't see
Cerilene, share my life with me
We'll go together hand in hand and we'll fulfill our dreams

Walked along the beach there hand in hand, it felt like a dream
But things that felt so good were never real or so it seemed
The magic that this girl possessed
Changed the heart of a child to a man (to a man)
Through the warmth of love his dreams and drive had direction again

A girl who strongly believes in me, and visions that we both could see
As one of my dreams, it came to an end
My life and love felt whole again

I've grown to love this family, my friends
And this woman that I've found
Just as much as the family I left in a small, small Southern town
On a day the island breezes brought my loved ones here with me
We made our families one, I love you, oh I love you Cerilene

Cerilene, the road of life is dark without you and I, I just can't see
Cerilene, share my life with me

Still agreed to disagree

So swallow the knife
Carve the way for your pride
Now our hands are tied
The problems lie within
So we pray for night
To start over again

Even now as I write this down
All pretensions disappear
Now our impulses will bite
At the ankles of our fear

So swallow the knife
Carve the way for your pride
Now our hands are tied
The problems lie within
So we pray for night
To start over again

Now our hands are tied
The problems lie within
So we pray for night
To start over again

Words are spoken
Words are broken down

So let's make this night
Be our best mistake
So let's take the time
To wipe the blood away

Now our hands are tied
And the world is caving in

Now our hands are tied

Tequila through Lucy's sequins.

The boom box sings ""Dandelion"".

You dropped the hammer of love
On me.

Don't drop the hammer of love

Now you're in the stars
Up in the autumn lights -
A stage set the befits
A Chieftain of our tribe.
Don't forget me
As I await my flight.
I wish on a star
For you tonight.

If there is a way it can be arranged -
When my time comes I'd like to, again, share a stage.

In the might of the mountains
Creatures concealed lurk in the shadows

Black voids in lifeless plains
Wake up dead in endless pain

Stares from the mirror on the wall
You think you know my problems
I think that you don't know my at all

I don't believe I suffer
Disease as you proclaim
And I don't believe that I should kneel and hang my head in shame

Held prisoner by a monkey
Strapped on behind my back
And while I sit ablaze
The light is slowly fading into the black
So I

I've got to medicate myself again
I've got to medicate myself again
I've got to medicate myself again

Cause you don't need me hanging 'round
One more drink and I will be drowned

I know you hate to see me
As I defeat myself this way
You know you can't control me
You know I'm slipping day by day

Down into my obsession
Down in the hole where I belong
And when this fight is over
You will stay right here and I will be gone
So I

I've got to medicate myself again 3x

I found you broken
And lying on the floor
An empty bottle in the drain
I put my hand right through the kitchen door

I've got to medicate myself again
Cause you don't need me hanging 'round
I barely get my coat off and you're already
Crawling down my back again
Yeah you get to watch me sinking down

Take this heart I've carved in stone

Just the other night
There was so much beauty
So much light

Don't you wish it was true
Don't you wish it was true

An angel took my hand
Said you don't have to hurry
Got all the time in the world
Don't worry

Don't you wish it was true
Lord, don't you wish it was true

But if tomorrow
Everybody was your friend
Anyone could take you in
No matter what or where you've been

But if tomorrow
Everybody had enough
The world wasn't quite so rough
Lord, don't you wish it was true

He said the world's gonna change
And it's starting today
There'll be no more armies
No more hate

Don't you wish it was true
Ah, don't you wish it was true

And all the little children
Who live happily
There'll be singing and laughter
Sweet harmony

Don't you wish it was true
Lord, Don't you wish it was true

But if tomorrow everybody under the sun 
Was happy just living as one
No borders or battles to be won

But if tomorrow
Everybody was your friend
Happiness would never end
Lord, don't you wish it was true

Alright

But if tomorrow everybody under the sun 
Was happy just to live as one

Doubting, unsettling and turning around, wondering what will come next
Is this the role that you wanted to live? I was foolish to ask for so much
Without the protection and infancy's guard, it all falls apart at first touch

Watching the reel as it comes to a close, brutally taking its time
People who change for no reason at all, it's happening all of the time
Can I go on with this train of events disturbing and purging my mind?
Back out of my duties, when all's said and done. I know that I'll lose every time

Moving along in our God-given ways, safety is sat by the fire
Sanctuary from these feverish smiles, left with a mark on the door
Is this the gift that I wanted to give? Forgive and forget's what they teach
Or pass through the deserts and wastelands once more and watch as they drop by the beach

This is the crisis I knew had to come, destroying the balance I'd kept
Turning around to the next set of lives, wondering what will come next"

Disappears without a trace

He is to the east coast what Snoop is,
To the west coast what Face is to Houston
Young Hov in the house it's so necessary
No bra with the blouse it's so necessary
No panties and jeans that's so necessary
Now why you frontin on me? is that necessary?
Do I, to you, look like a lame

See the stars come falling down from the sky
Gently passing they kiss your tears that you cry
See the wind come softly blow your hair from your face
And the rain comes falling down in its crazy ways

Still I'm sad
Still I'm sad

For myself my tears just fall in the dust
Day will dry them and night will find they're lost
See the wind come softly blow time into my heart
And the rain comes falling down while we're apart

Still I'm sad
Still I'm sad

See the stars come falling down from the sky
Gently passing they kiss your tears that you cry
See the wind come softly blow your hair from your face
And the rain comes falling down in its crazy ways

I'm so sad

But still I'm sad
Feeling so sad
Feeling so bad
You're making me sad
Making me bad
I'm sad

For myself my tears just fall in the dust
As I search in the night and find they're lost
See the wind come gently blow time into my heart
And the rain comes falling down while we're apart

See the wind come softly blow your hair from your face

To the day I was your valentine
No halo over your head
We stayed at home and spent the day in bed
Your skin so hot to the touch
I never wanted anyone so much
You're a sight for sore eyes to see
Won't somebody come and rescue me

I've spent along time away
And it's good to be home
And together is better than being alone
It's a far cry from anything I've ever felt like before
Yes and long is the road
That's been leading me back to your door

A daydream out of the blue
Into something so sad but true
An old friend back from the dead
To steal the covers sleeping in your bed

I never meant to be an aggravation
I'm only looking for a second chance
I'm so hard-headed that determination
Left me all alone
That's why I'm coming home
Running all the way"

You inspired. Now expired, it has died for nothing

Some stop feeling love for every word that they once sung
May I never lose my youth and if I do, may I be forgettable

You said you started up this home because you didn't like the way these kinds of things were run
You've said you understand the work it takes to make us grow
If you had then where were you?
We've paid our dues without you
Am I the only one who sees all of the deceit and festering hypocrisy?

Don't ever talk to me like you think you know me or what I've been through
I am nothing like you!

In daylight we're oblivion
Our hearts so raw and clear
Are turning away, turning away from here

On water we have walked like the fearless child
What was fastened we've unlocked revealing wondrous wild
And in search for confirmation
We have jumped into the fire
And scrambled with our burning feet through uncontrolled desire

There's a well upon the hill from our ancient past
Where an age is standing still holding strong and fast
And there's those that try to tame it
And the carve it into stone
Ah but words cannot extinguish it
However hard they're thrown

On Racherie they have worked with their island dreams
By Lough Cleggan they have nourished in the mountain streams
And in searching for acceptance
They have given it away
Only the children of our children
Know the price they had to pay"

Why should we even care?

Kills the people he once saved

But only one King became a baby

He left behind His throne of pure light
Gave up His crown that we might be free
He chose a manger that Bethlehem night
And reaching through time and space He saw me
With no joy, no peace, no hope in sight

So He came with starlight and love in His eyes
No regal welcome for His infant cries
There have been many babies to become a king
But only one King became a baby

He could have chosen to break through the sky
With anthem and angel wing
But He knew we'd understand a baby's cry

Back in the days when I first read

When Zacheus was a wee little man
And a wee little man was he
With my child like faith
And my clip-on tie
I would raise my hand
Raise my hand high

Stories just like mine, I begin to discover
I want to read my Bible from cover to cover

There's still a fountain flowing deep
Deep in the heart of me it widens my memory
Makes me remember the pledge I made
To follow the Master from here to ever after

I've stood strong like Daniel
I've fallen like David
I've wandered in the desert like the Israelites
I've denied You like Peter
I've struggled like Paul
Run from You like Jonah
But You loved me through it all

I want to read my Bible from cover to cover

E dá mais de três mil pau

Tantos filhos pra criar
Dá-lhe shampoo anti-caspas
Dois comprimidos pra jantar

Não esqueça o perfume da mulher que tu tem
Nem procure desculpas pra dizer à sua filha que o Noel não vem
Papai Noel não vem
Deixe de lado o jogo de faca dos seus sonhos
E vá buscar seu cachorro no cabeleireiro

Não esqueça a data de vencimento
Não esqueça o presente de sua cunhada (ai ai)
E perca peso agora
Perca peso agora

Se hoje seu café amanhecer gelado
Se hoje sua mulher dormir do lado errado
Podia estar mau, mas está pior
E a tendência é se agravar
Não é melhor se engravatar?

Eis que faltou
Aquele motivo pra pirar
Mas não há porque se preocupar
A sua hora vai chegar
E você vai se encontrar

Bebe água, dorme, não troca a cueca
Acorda, defeca e Amém
Olha, gosta, compra
Perde, vende, troca ou aluga
Sua calvície nasce prematura
Como você se atura?
Bêbado se dorme, cueca não se troca
Decora e afeta sua mente
Ira, tira, tora a tara, atura

Não esqueça a mulher do perfume, tenta o quê?
Nem procure sua filha pra dizer que Noel, desculpa, não vem
Eu disse, ele não vem
Deixe seus sonhos de lado
Use as facas para o jogo
E vá morar com o cabeleireiro, seu cachorro

Não esqueça o vencimento da data
Não esqueça o casamento da chata
Não esqueça a cunhada do seu tormento (ai ai)

Än sen, det kan väl knappast du förbjuda 
I varje ord finns ljuset gömt
Som längtan, eller hopplös dröm
Ett heligt eller brustet Halleluja
Halleluja…)

Jag ville väl men det gjorde ont 
Min mun var full men mitt hjärta tomt 
Men jag svär, dig har jag aldrig velat lura
Fast allt blev fel och falskt och fult
Så jag nu står inför min Gud 
Och kan jag bara ropa Halleluja
Halleluja…"

I wanna tell you a little story about a party in this song...

It happened back in '93, in the PITTSBURG PUNK ROCK SCENE
An event that will go down, in infamy
It was all the masterplan, of one legendary PUNK ROCK KID
His name was ""Spaz"", S-P-A-Z

An eviction notice to his house sparked off an idea
""I should have one last party at my place...""
So off he set with his master plan, the invitation in his hand read:
""You're invited to my House Destruction Party!""

Spaz's House Destruction Party, it was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough to make the House Destruction Party then you know
You're lucky that you lived

Let's go!

We played there St. Patrick's Day with Submachine and THE BAD GENES
In a basement full of debris
From kicked in doors, broken glass, knocked in walls, THE PLACE WAS THRASHED
The house was now missing it's support beams

The bathrooms had no toilets or sinks left in them
There was nothing in the kitchen left to break
Aus Rotten spray painted on the walls, drunk punks passed out in the halls
And this was just the second night of the three-day long party

Spaz's House Destruction Party, it was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough to make the House Destruction Party then you know
You're lucky that you lived

The cops showed up and all the kids went piling out the back
I remember running away and hiding out in the lot behind the Squirrel Hill Mellon Bank
The cop said, ""I wanna speak to someone who lives here!"" and this punk kid said she did
He asked, ""Is this the condition the house has always been in?""
She answered, ""Uh... yeah, it is.""

Spaz's House Destruction Party, it was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough to make the House Destruction Party then you know
You're lucky that you lived

I hear the flapping of wings,
The bestoking tranquillity of irredescent spectrum,
The birds circle around my presence,
Hinting at pale sightings of Kadmos,
All alone for dust ridden aeons,
Alienation Your inner method of nirvana,
There is no night, no day -
Kadmos Your preserved brotherhood,
The ivory Your only solace,
In flight we persevere into the lights of the ivory plains,
Structures from silence,
Petals in the stream,
Murk above the dark moor,
The eastwinds brush the dust from Your prophetic throne,
In lands of I never saw,
Where the equinox was permanent,
The elephants trun the icon of Your only existence,
For their is nothing else,
In flight we persevere into the mists of ivory plains,
Foregather in the name of Moros and remember our lands."

Some folks drift along through life and never thrill
To the feeling that a good deed brings until
It's too late and they are ready to lie down
There beneath the leaves that's scattered on the ground

Lord, let my eyes see every need of every man
Make me stop and always lend a helping hand
Then when I'm laid beneath that little grassy mound
There'll be more friends around than leaves upon the ground

To your grave there's no use taking any gold
You cannot use it when it's time for hands to fold
When you leave this earth for a better home someday

Like a virgin POW on the peaks of A.K.
Like a sound that goes the depths of the soul

A little wine with my dinner so I'm in my grape Ape
'I feel like a winner when I make a mix tape
Cause, I get ill when I'm on the pause button
And I get my fill and now you can't say nothin'

More soul on this train than Don Cornelious

There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning

I said there ain't no woman like the one I got
Yes I know, I know

There was a time when my heart was dragging on the floor
And I thank God for the day that I saw your face and you
Smiled at me
And you took my hand and you stole my heart away

I lost all my friends
'Cause I ain't got time left for them

Because there ain't no woman likke the one I got

I don't have a lot, but I'm proud of what I've got
I can't complain
'Cause I see people hangin' round, on the city streets downtown
Living on pocket change
There're times I've been confused, felt that I was born to lose
Oh but I survived
Unlike the one's who pray and feel more than blessed each day
To just be still alive

Is there something we can do
Seems the odds against survival are a million to one
The only hope they have will die
In the hearts of you and I if nothing's ever done
I can't save them by myself
Oh but God forbid that I just turn my head
And walk on by
Don't let me be a stranger to those less fortunate than I

Seems that old golden rule, that I learned back in school
Has lost its shine
It's a crying shame, and I wonder could the blame
Be yours and mine
Discipline was tough, and that old principal was rough
But the times were good
'Cause no one ever found one single child shot down
In the neighborhood

Is there something we can do
Seems the odds against survival are a million to one
'Cause every day that passes by
Another street gang victim dies
And still there's nothing done
I can't save them by myself
Oh but God forbid that I just run away somewhere and hide
From the fear and the danger of those less fortunate than I
Lord don't let me be a stranger to those less fortunate than I"

I was alone out there, with no one else around
Now I've fallen for you, and there's no coming down

Till there was you, I know what you're needing
My thoughts are leading, me straight into your eyes
What can I do? I'm looking right at you
This feeling is all new, I want you addicted to me

Fate can act in a curious way
When all that mattered means nothing today
All that concerns me, that drenches my thoughts
Is the sensation that seeing you brought

I was alone out there, with no one else around

Reminds me of the way
You entered right into my heart and soul
Love shines through, love shines through

Now I'm a little older
And nothing else could ever smolder
This burning fire

They say that love grows colder
And fairy tales are life's own fables
They're all a lie

Now I lay awake at night and pray
That I hear the little things You say
Love shines through me and now, it consumes me
I cannot believe what You're doing for me, oh

Love shines through every day
Reminds me of the way
You entered right into my heart and soul
Love shines through, love shines

And every little thing You do
Is evidence You're true, I believe You

Love shines through every day
Reminds me of the way
You entered right into my heart and soul
Love shines through, love shines through

Tells a mortal affliction

Such an urgency
That we need each other
So desperatly oh can't you see

It's a long way home
It's a long way home
Lets walk together
Instead of alone
On this long way home

I've gone through the pages
Of a lot of magazines
Full of angry looking rockstars
And airbrushed beauty queens
And next to each picture
Is a caption that read
Oh your life will be better
If you have what we have
And the message grows louder
As we fall further from grace

So lets speak to each other
Of a better place

Oh 'cause it's a
Long way home
It's a long long way home
Lets walk together
Instead of alone

And ought to be restored before it dies

It must be love that we keep trying to hear
'Cause I imagined this kind of vvonderful choice
I imagine you hear the very same voice
When I speak to you
You say ""That's just my imagination""
Oh no, no, no
It Must Be Love
It Must Be Love

Perhaps one girl who was moving in a fine line
Finds one boy in back
That she can always stand behind
And it's you and me
'Cause that's where we want to be
Oh, It Must Be Love,
It Must Be Love

People look through everything they see
'Cause there's so many other things to be
I have seen you walking in the rain
I wanted to know why you were crying
I wanna fix what's wrong...

It must be love the sailor sails for
Must be love that drives a bottle to the bottom of the ocean floor
Because I imagine all kinds of wonderful water
I would have you there wherever I'll go
Way from the seventh sea,
He brings the bottle back to me
Oh, It Must Be Love
Oh, It Must Be Love
People look through evervthing thev see
There's so many other things to be
I have seen you walking in the rain
I want to know whv vou were crying
Baby, let me fix what's wrong...

It must be love that fathoms the moonlight
Must be love that shallovvs
The deepest part of the night
So you can show them vvith vour eye
The things that make them cry,
Because that Must Be Love
It Must Be Love...
And the way you are
Must Be Love
And the things vou Feel
Oh, It Must Be Love,
Oh, It Must Be Love
Must Be Love"

But the reason I must go, is on the other hand

In your arms I feel the passion, I thought had died
When I looked into your eyes, I found myself
And when I first kissed your lips, I felt so alive

Engañosas, engañosas
Todas ellas engañosas
Pero yo me las creí
Los pulsos tuve paraos
Y hasta el corazón perdió
Cuando tus labios enamoraos
Dijeron casi cerraos
Como a nadie te he querío
Como a nadie te he querío
Como a nadie te querrá.

De tu engaño y tu falsía
A mi no me importa nada
De tu engaño y tu falsía
Que todo fue una locura.

Que todo fue una locura
Y fui más feliz que nadie
Soñando que te quería
Con fiebre de calentura.

Todo lo doy por bien hecho
Todo lo doy por perdió
Pero me sangra mi pecho
Pensando que me has querío.

Tantos cosas, tantas cosas
Me dijiste tantas cosas
Que a tu embrujo me rendí.
Engañosas, engañosas
Todas ellas engañosas
Pero yo me las creí
Los pulsos tuve paraos
Y hasta el corazón perdió
Cuando tus labios enamoraos
Dijeron casi cerraos
Como a nadie te he querío
Como a nadie te he querío
Como a nadie te querrá."

Lost my coffee cup
Make things disappear
Then I make things up
I lost you, then I lost my way
And I make it difficult for you to say the things you want to say

I am right, right in the eye, of the storm, and I am wondering why

I have been watching, oh I I've been watching you
There are so many, so many secrets I've been keeping too

Open the coffin, there's nothing inside
There are fake stars shining in the sky
And when I wake up I find I am still dreaming
In the bathtub, the salmon are teeming

Maybe I need to see something grow
See black soil, green shoots
Maybe I need to touch down
I need heavier boots

I have been watching, oh I I've been watching you
There are so many, so many secrets I've been keeping too

Somehow the spaces between the words grew
How long till there are no more traces of you

You found my phone, found my coffee cup
You made things appear, as if the rain fell up
Does it come down to laundry and dishes
Do these desires become impossible wishes"

Aus dem Papamobil mit getönten Scheiben 
Du kannst gerne schreien, die Wände sind schalldicht 
Du kannst für mich testen, wie kalt es im Wald ist 
Komm mich besuchen, mein Zimmer ist die Zelle 8-8 
Ich habe viel Platz, mein Zimmerkollege ist nicht aufgewacht 
Er hängt von der Decke, doch der Hurensohn tropft 
Du willst rennen, komm und renne ohne Beine, ohne Kopf 
Ich mach keine Gefangenen, aber lebendige Möbel 
Deine Mutter sucht Geld, sie erkennt dich beim Trödel 
Meine Freunde, die Vögel, picken die Reste auf 
Ich hab eine meiner Vogelscheuchen-Masken auf 
Ich zieh mir deine Haut über meinen Kopf 
Denn ich mach mit deiner Braut im Wald ein Picknick 
Jeder meiner Leute will mal auf sie rauf 
Und ich gebe jedem ein Stück mit 
Deine immer nasse, frische Mutter sucht im Internet nach heißen Exoten 
Ich komme mit Grabstein zum Rendezvous 
Direkt zurück von den Toten 
Ich habe keine Zeit mehr, die Sonne geht auf 
Mein Ende naht, ich mauer meine Fenster zu 
Und male meine Wände schwarz

Es ist Walpurgisnacht, ich breche aus der Klapse aus 
Setze meine Schweinekopf-Maske auf 
Raste aus 
Ab jetzt hast du vier Väters

Triff mich mit Klampfe unter dei'm Fenster, Baby, ich sing ""Mi amore"" 
Seh scheiße aus, doch ich ficke dich trotzdem, Nico (Nico!) Briatore

Deine Mutter verkauft ihre Fotze vor Aldi 
Rein in den Club, Schwänze in die Höh' 
Deine Braut hat meine Wurst drin, Cordon bleu 
Tötörötö, riesiger Rüssel, riesiger Hass, riesiger Appetit 
Du denkst, du bist mit deiner Frau bei IKEA, denn sie hat sich in einen Schrank verliebt 
Mit Messer und Gabel, die Schweinekopf-Maske auf meinem Gesicht durch das Fenster 
Der Bonhoeffer rostet im Norden Berlins, vertrauenserweckender Tremper 
Massimo ist da, ich fahre mit Wodka im Getriebe 
Von dem ersten Vorschuss kaufe ich mir eine Niere 
Und 'ne neue Leber und 'ne neue Lunge, Tarek, bitte, bitte, mach ein Backup, denn ich hyperventiliere 
Und wenn sie nicht ficken will, denk ich mir: Scheiß drauf! 
Nimm den Penis und erwische sie mit einem Streifschuss 
Deine Alte sammelt jedes Wochenende Pilze, aber nicht im Wald

Die Sonne scheint mir (mir, mir) aus dem Arsch 
Dein Album scheint mir (mir, mir) ganz schön scheiße zu sein

Salzsäure in meiner Wasserpistole, ein typischer K.I.Z.-Schenkelklopfer 
Hasse den Bunker, nach dieser CD bist du Untermieter in meiner Hundehütte 
Häng deine goldene Platte an die Wand, wir haben Platinteller in der Unterlippe 
Jetzt gibt es ein neuen Boss in dei'm Haus 
Tarek, K.I.Z., hat das Schloss ausgetauscht 
Du hörst zu über die Sprechanlage 
Wie ich deine Schwester mit Salz und Pfeffer jage 
Dein Papa mein neuer Geldgeber 
Meiner sieht aus wie der Hellraiser 
Ich hole dich ab wie ein Feldjäger 
Gott ist ein Schiri und gab mir Elfmeter, denn ich bin ein Pimp, auf meinem Sack ein Pentagramm 
Nenn mich den Sex-Terroristen, denn ich spreng dein' Darm

Die Sonne scheint mir (mir, mir) aus dem Arsch 
Dein Album scheint mir (mir, mir) ganz schön scheiße zu sein

todo lo que perdí
eso no es para mi
material de vida,
botellas y almas queridas
que la noche sublima
en su medialuz.
Antes de ser varón
yo se que fui mujer
lo siento al recordar
algunos tramos
cuando me miro las manos
y son de un lejano
pais de otra piel.

Nostalgia de otra vida
carbón que da la mina
la fuerza necesaria para arder
y en los ojos del espacio
va silvandome despacio
que soy trigo
pa' que otros puedan comer,
esto no termina nunca
el amor es la pregunta
y si estuve en otra vida fui mujer.
Conozco la canción
falsia del querer
la trágica comedia de la hombria
creeen que llorar afemina
y el dolór los obliga
a llorar como mujer."

My body's tired, but my thoughts are running deep
I guess I know just what you're going through
Because I kind of feel the same way too
Looking back, there was nothing we could do

It's not easy what you're going through
You call me up, and I'm still wondering what to do
We both admit that it's gone too far
We're just trying to find out who we are
Lonely nights is something that I don't want to see

Now you're free and living fast
It's not easy looking at the past
It gets harder every day when you're running away

Running away

Looking back we shared a lot
Is it worth it all to let go of what we got
All at once you can't ignore the fact
Some where some how we got off the track
Give it up, it's changing you and changing me

If we have the chance to turn the clock back
Who knows how or when
Would it happen all again

Now you're free and living fast
It's so tough to make a good thing last
It get's harder everyday when you're running away

It's not easy living on your own
You miss your friends you want to go back home
It gets harder everyday when you're running away

Got to give the people
Give the people what they want
Ladies and Gentlemen

Verse One: Erick Sermon

When I came out with my first rap jam
I had no idea that the record would slam
It did real good without radio play
Maybe at night but no airplay in the day
I couldn't understand why to be exact
Our music was good and I was far from wack
Then came the answer, commercial was the key
To get airplay and a spot on TV
Like Ed Lover and Doctor Dre from Yo! MTV Raps
A show, mainly for the black
And still we can't ill, cause to them that's wrong
Cause like P.E. said, we're too black and too strong
But hey, what can I say
(Brothers and sisters) that's a price a rapper must pay

Verse Two: PMD

As airwaves collapse rap shows at a standstill
Some racial circuits the frequencies can't handle
The funk tracks produced by EPMD
But it's a fat jam, that will never win a grammy
Unless we sellout and kill the black movement dead
Which means swallow our pride and become flunkies instead
And stop the rap about freedom, thoughts of a black president
And rap about a black crack, the mayor in our residence
Give me a break brothers, it's time to take a stand
And kill that no sir, yes sir, and thank you ma'am
'Cause the word is a luxury a black man can't afford
That's why poverty's on the rise and we still ignored
And it's a setback and yet the clock still ticks
And if we let it, rap would be run by politics
I read it somewhere that every man's created equal
But not in this day and age, maybe in the sequel
Which means next time, so observe these rhymes
And take a stand and go for yours 'cause I'm going for mine
That's why I

Verse Three: Erick Sermon, PMD

Why is that when wrong is done by the black
It's blown out of proportion and immediately attacked
By the press and yes, conflict is caused
By the kids at concerts who bumrush the doors
One child gets hurt, the press gets pesty
But what about the Beatles, G, and Elvis Presley
Same stuff was rough, rap does not cause violence
So (Fight the Power) and make them understand
But too much power and you might get banned
So if you want airplay
You can't be too black and hey, watch what you say, but ayo

Because I know I've seen what the others should have to see
Who left the light in these blinded eyes?

The fight our mothers and fathers could
They rocked the system and changed their lives

I turned my face away

So I don't have to breathe

Tell me when did I go wrong?

You were so blind to let me go
You had it all but did not know
No one you'll find will ever be
Closer to all your dreams than me

Believing the grass would be greener
You told yourself, ""I just don't need her now.""
But I know you'll soon discover
You're never satisfied with any other

Someday, ooh someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey, hey
Boy you're gonna pay, 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

You'll change your mind and call my name
Soon as you find they're all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don't come back crying, you should have known

Believe me, I'm not pretending
It's not hard to predict this ending now
'Cause I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me in spite of all the others

Someday, ooh someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey, hey

(Someday, ooh someday)
(One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for)
(Someday, hey, hey)
(Boy you're gonna pay, 'cause) baby I'm the one who's keeping score

Maybe now you just can't conceive
That there'll ever come a time when you're cold and lonely
Baby, how could you ever believe
That another could replace me, the one and only

But when you're down in your time of need
And you're thinking that you
Might be coming back to own me
Just think again 'cause
I won't need your love anymore

Someday, ooh someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey, hey
Boy you're gonna pay, 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

Ever so nervously, people lookin' down on me, telling me it's all right

If it were up to me I'd tear down this whole city, what's all this shit here for?
I give you my heart, but you just say I make you feel like a whore

All this trouble just to die, all this trouble's only temporary, it's temporary, temporary

Took away his power but he hides a tiny flower in the corner of his jail cell
Never been outside he just can't hide, he'd just assume be in hell

Get off the fucking telephone, why'd you hate to be alone, paranoid of death and love
Ever so patiently we sit upon our sinking ship waiting for the black dove

All this trouble just to die, all this trouble's only temporary, it's temporary, temporary

Sad that I could make it, glad that I could fake, sorry but I got to go
I ain't afraid of cryin', ain't afraid of dyin'. ain't afraid of what I don't know"

It's a way to change the tide
When the world is crumblin' down 'round you and me
It's the calm that lifts the storm
It's the promise that keeps you warm

You pulled away
But you wanted me to stay
Instead you ran away

We gotta compromise

And tell me what's wrong
Come sit down next to me
And let me feel the vibe you're on
Come lay your head on me
And everything will be all right

You'll be coming clean tonight
And I'll be falling down with you once again
Call me your valentine, call me once tonight
And haven't said that it's okay

The things you said, I'm rehearsing them

They went back on us
(Closed eyes rolled back couldn't step it up)
I could know him to come on to it
It's the thought that emerges
(Take back couldn't step it up)
I could never love, the idle thing

Bury your head
Has the child smashed you down
And the psalms will never call me again

I'll sleep tonight

Sold right and all
They wandered around and round my mouth,
They stole my life
Sold right and all

They have been the ones who've seen enough

But now I'm walking on sacred ground
I didn't know Your touch could save me
But look what I've found
I dreamt you took me to the river
And I woke up baptized in Your light

I'm giving my love to You only
I'm giving my love, my love, giving my sweet soul love
I know with you I'll never know lonely
I'm giving my love, my love, giving my sweet soul love

Now that all my prayers are answered
Let me show you what faith can do
I never let myself believe in forever
Till I met You, it's true. I do
You Took the burden off my shoulders
So I can always be praising you

I'm giving my love to You only
I'm giving my love, my love, giving my sweet soul love

Not lost, not thrown away
Just irritated and quite hated
Self control breaks down

Why's everything so tame?
I like my life insane
I'm barricading and debating
Who I'm gonna kick around

Right now, can't find a way to get across the hate when I see you
Right now, I feel it scratch inside, I wanna slash and beat you
Right now, I rip apart the things inside that excite you
Right now, I can't control myself, I fucking hate you

I'm feeling cold today
Not hurt, just fucked away
I'm devastated and frustrated
God I feel so bound

So when I feel the need
I think it's time to bleed
I'm gonna cut myself
A watch the blood
Hit the ground

Right now, can't find a way to get across the hate when I see you
Right now, I feel it scratch inside, I wanna slash and beat you
Right now, I rip apart the things inside that excite you
Right now, I can't control myself, I fucking hate you

You open your mouth again
I swear I'm gonna break it
You open your mouth again
My God I cannot take it

Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up

Let that playa ass nigga Twista be your guide as we go on a ride
Where playa hatin' killers and the hood niggaz thrive
And lame motherfuckers can barely survive

One morning I woke up next to a thick bitch
Took a shower dried off brushed the gold teeth like Slick Rick
Tapped on Obsession colonge like Doug E. Fresh in the flesh
Think I'm blessed with the zest after slippin on my slick fit
The high discover me, hit the front porch
Two women butterly lovely in front of me got my head gone
I sent the bitch in the bed home 'cause one of them
Got chocolate big thighs and the other one was a redbone
Where y'all goin' y'all thick as hell
What's your name I wanna get up with y'all tonight shit
I got some homies that lonely never phony we on some hype shit
Call up the buddies you be tight with
We ain't really gon be doin' too much though
We just ridin' around bumpin sounds trippin' out while we flame janes
Tappin the horn at the homies that gangbang
And slang 'caine to maintain to mob's the same thing
Or we can chill at the crib and play spades or kick some ass a bit
Speedpass the clit and get passionate
Grab the buckle and unfasten it
And we can get into some ol' nasty shit
Live if I could decide to try, don't play me bogus
This ain't no spin move and I ain't got no time to lie
Tell your girls we gonna be sliding by
But hit the weed tip first cause my clique got to be riding high
Cause it feels so good

It feels so good how we kick it in the hood like so good
(When we ridin' high)
Rollin' through the hood with Phillies and hoes
Straight pimpin' with nowhere to go
And it feels so good the way we kick it in the hood like so good
(When we ridin' high)
Rollin' through the hood with Phillies and hoes
Straight pimpin' with nowhere to go

Me and my homies hooked up some cowards took up
When niggas we lust smokin' some but the flame tight
Trippin' off how we survivin the rugged terrain
And try to hang tight getting fucked up on gang night
Used to be gang fights now we gotta try to relax with the scrap
Even we sent Deebo back to back to back
We still be holdin' stacks of packs
Rollin' through wit black blacks, blunt reds, ash trays, and crack sacks
Hustlin and chillin's what I'm focusin on
Fiendin through bitch's cribs hopin it's on
If ain't no strokin we strollin along
Rollin' the chrome out really trippin'
Because we take the smoke to the dome
Bumpin the tunes while bigger roles and herringbones
Glisten from all the sunlight
Peepin the fe's with their hair done tight
Booty hung right and every night we see at least one fight
Hookin up with my fellow Westside cliques
Now together we mush
But when are we strapped through and rug cutters
Just like the envy and jealousy throughout the other is love brothers
Ridin' every one of y'all my muhfuckers
So put the Black Magic on the tires and get the wax off the chrome
We gon' to blaze on till my brain's blown
Hopin to get my thang on
Not matter what block you stay on kick it
Round the world it's the same song
(So the Mobsters just flame on)
For scratch we was willin' to squirt some blood
Now we got up on hittin the 'cause
From stealin' tips where they're swum the doves
Mo' we got up on some bud
Straight hittin' up the block searching for love
Reach up and hit the deep lung then we gone
Smokin' delight the body right what the party like
Are you as live as I come roll with meso we can ride the sky
But only if you let me play with you while we ridin' high
Cause it feels so good

Sittin' back cruising through the slow breeze
Thinkin' how can I get mo' cheese
Bumpin a system costin 4 G's
I stay on my P's for the po-P's
Split the Phillie with my door keys
Scoop a female to the crib good get my boy to bring a blessin through
Sit on the floor playin' Tekken 2
Lesson two I'm adressin you
Turn out the lights like the World Class Wreckin' Crew
Bring out the best in you
Confessin true lies about your inner thighs
And where they been hopin maybe you be my lady
What's the potatoes without the gravy
What you feelin' on maybe soft with the silicone baby
But can you pay me?
Cause daily we be riding in the dope stroll
While rockin' dope flows I'll lose the spot if I choose to stop
We can cruise some blocks and talkin' about
How later on you comin' out your clothes, shoes and socks
Now is that news or not?
Come I step on the gas slow and smoke on this last ""O""
Get a ""B"" and split it now watch me kill it
Tinted windows took a sealin' off in the Astro
On billets take a choke on so I can really feel it
Thinkin' about not having the rich life
But the hood life was still a good life
And that we know always and forever though
For ever more rollin' in the ghetto with nowhere to go
And it feels so good"

Remove all gods from my way, and thoughts, and sorrows
And let me trespass the barriers of fear

Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend.
I'm not thinking 'bout him, but you married him
Do you know I made him leave
Do you know he begged to stay, with me
He wasn't man enough for me

Listen, girl,
Didn't he tell you the truth?
If not then why don't you ask him
Then maybe you can be more into him
Instead of worrying about me
And hopefully you won't buy
All of the reasons why his love didn't count
And why we couldn't work it out

Oh yeah, so many reasons why our love is through, yeah
What makes you think he'll be good to you, no
It makes no sense 'cause he will never change

I can't tell you what to do

You can make it if you try

How everybody's got a dream but they feel they won't win
'Cause somebody who was willin', who wanted to be chillin'
So they could never make it even if they were willin'
So we threw together this old school flow
So everybody in my generation oughta know
No matter what we take from this scene
Now you and me can follow our dreams

I can't tell you what to do

You can make it if you try

Who worked the rivers run
His wife would cook his meals,
As he would check the wheels.

Singin' poor Tom, Seventh Son,
Always knew what's goin' on.

Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom
And there ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom.

He worked for thirty years
Sharin' hopes 'n' fears
Dreamin' of the day
He could turn and say

Poor Tom, work's gone,
Lazin' out in the noonday sun.

Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom
And there ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom.

His wife was Emmie May
One of many games she played
When Tom was out of town,
She couldn't keep her dresses down.

A-poor Tom, Seventh Son,
Always knew what's goin' on.

Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom
And there ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom.

And so it was one day
People got to Emmie May
A-Tom took a gun in his hand
And stopped all the runnin' around.

Poor Tom, Seventh Son,
Gotta die for what you've done.

All those years of work are thrown away.
To ease your mind, is that all you can say?
But what about that grandson on your knee?
And then wrote songs as well as he could be.

Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
And there ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
And there ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
And there ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom.

I dig your smile, too
And you dig my poker face

Threw stones at your window

I'm missing my sweet pea
Airports and handkerchiefs
And broken families

Went very far away
Some people, they don't hurt
Just in it for the chase

For flirtation and free loving

Où même le roi de la jungle abdique
Loin de la savane et des vastes plaines

Crinière en calvitie, derrière son grillage
Il ne tourne même plus comme un lion en cage
A quoi bon encore jouer les bêtes féroces
Quand on ne fait même plus peur aux gosses
Sous la volière des rapaces résignés
Regardent en l'air sans plus rien espérer
A côté les simagrées des singes sans gène
Et un petit train que les enfants dédaignent
Un couple d'éléphants piétine d'ennui
Aux défenses d'ivoire inutiles et ternies
Pour essayer d'atténuer la déprime qui les gagne
Faudrait un Lexomil gros comme un pain de campagne
Est-ce que chez eux, les enfants d'Afrique
Vont visiter des parcs zoologiques
Pour voir enfermées des bêtes qui viennent de loin
des chats, des pigeons, des horodateurs ou des chiens

Think of how I called your name out loud
Think of how if you weren't so proud
You could be my lover

And then when your plane touches solid ground
And the taxi whisks you on into town
In the glittering lights I'll be all around
'Cause we belong with each other

Oh, I'll go anywhere anytime
I'll go anywhere anytime honey
I'll go anywhere anytime

Take a warm coat for the snow

So the fall came, thirteen years, a shiny ring and how I could forget your name
The air no longer in my throat, another perfect lie is choked but it always feels the same

So they close together, dressed in red and yellow, innocent forever. Sleeping children in their blue soft rooms still dream

This is where we all meet

Wonderful in all your ways
Holy You are holy Lord

When your love breaks through
And I am swept away
By just a glimpse of you

When you make me new
Till I'm nothing less than
What I find in You

I will lift my voice to you
And sing it with the angels
You are holy, You are holy

And unto the Lamb

急ぎ走り　胸で揺れるネックレスが知らせる
甘い果実だけの頃の幸せな関係
かかと出し　半端に履く靴も気にしないで

Yeah... Once again
It's like this...

AotP, we runnin' this rap shit now
Celph Titled, we runnin' this rap shit now
ES, we runnin' this rap shit now
Warchild, niggas runnin' this rap shit now

(Verse 1: Celph Titled)
It's about to be a motherfuckin' slaughter in this bitch
We got the awfullest clips, rusty burners with the rotten rubber grips
We some hardcore crooks, drinkin' rubbing alcohol
Never use a rubber at all, we fuckin' bitches raw
Chokin' up your faculty, turn your whole ""gang green""
Unload the magazine to your knees, give you a gangsta lean
Military minded, on the A-Train with a deranged brain
I was buildin' the walls of hell way before the flames came
And bitches love me with a MAC-11
Tellin' the police sketch artist I look like Jon B. with a deadly weapon
Keepin' it ghetto even when it's war, ock
Rockin' jean shorts and a tanktop, loadin' shells in the tank top
Aimin' the cannon to blast you where you standin'
You could be in Montana campin', but your head'll land in the Hamptons
Won't grin for the camera when you clickin' it at me
But I'll smile with a gun in my hand, I'm trigger happy

[Chorus: Crypt the Warchild + Vinnie Paz] (x2)
Listen up, it's murder music till your wrist is cut
Fire octane, nigga y'all can sip it up
We do this rap shit here so we can live it up
We walk around with hot flames runnin', give it up

(Verse 2: Esoteric)
You could never fathom the level beyond your God or your Devil
If every thought is a pebble (my style's boulder, I told you)
A radical rebel and yes the jacket's full-metal
And men I'm hackin' through several (I'm like a soldier, I'll fold you)
A blow to your composure, heat of the moment
I be meat-cleavin' a bleedin' opponent, he didn't want it
These heathens try to eat off me but they repeatedly clone it
This industry is mine, I can put my feet way up on it
I put my people up on it, my sinister and lethal ministry of evil
Turn a Vinnie Diesel to a skinny weasel
I'm the pinnacle and steeple of this faction, feeble men I'm smashin'
Playin' God? you ain't Jim Caviezel with The Passion
Automatic how I'm causin' havoc, I body maggots
Who thought they brought the static, they probably addicts
And fiendin' for a bag of this antagonistic savageness
You talkin' platinum but ain't crackin' pitchers' batting averages

(Verse 3: Crypt the Warchild)
Don't make me get your fuckin' face broken
I ain't jokin' when I'm flamethrowin'
I'll spit a verse at you to slit your fuckin' veins open
I'll spit a curse or two just to keep the rain pourin'
I'll lift the skirt of you to see you pussies ain't workin'
I'll live to murder you until I see the game's over
We never heard of you and 'cause of that, the name's worshipped
(It's the Army, cocksuckas) Get it correct
Or y'all can find sharp things straight embedded in necks
I rep my team to the death, I will slice your people
Wave my flags in the air, plus the knives are lethal
Hottest shit to hit the streets since Nas did Ether
Now we pick at your soul and let your conscience eat ya
And take over, Crypt, Es, and Celph
You reap what you sow, so protect ya health, NIGGA

Won't let me go nowhere

And now I'm finding numbers

Chicks calling the house non-stop
It's getting out of control
Finally I can't take no more

Saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend

I will fly until I sing this free. (Stop, surrender to fate.)
A servant to your dreams, this blood will spill.
Ruining your dreams that I despise,
I will not strike till I see the whites of your eyes.
And only then you'll feel the fury.

I got a full and I bet 'em high
But my bluff didn't work on a certain guy
He just kept on raisin' and layin' that money down

He'd raise me, I'd raise him
I sweated blood, you gotta sink or swim
He finally called, didn't raise the bet

I said ""aces full pal, how 'bout you?""

One 'em high-bred, uptown, fancy little dames

That everything's were like it oughta be
So hand in hand we strolled down lover's lane

She was oh so far from a chunk of ice
Our smoochin' party was goin' real nice
So help me, Hannah I'm thinking I've been there yet

I give her a kiss, a little squeeze

Es monitor de yoga y de relajación,

Desde que estoy con éste lo paso genial,
Es multiorgásmico y eso es fenomenal,
Yo te lo aseguro, estoy maravillá.

El cosmos está hecho para explorar,
Volamos muy alto juntos los dos,

And I'm waiting for the Lord oh please don't leave me forsaken
Caught up in the doom prepare for Satan
We facing a situation while I'm drunk and scared
Heavily sedated wonder will I make it to the pearly gates
Or will I burn off in that lake now,
Could you feel the earthquake shaking the dead awake
How many wait it's too late it's over now
Niggas had a lack of faith so life ain't straight, if you incapable,
Having a little trouble a day wid ah fiend or somethin'
Betta plead to bloody Jesus
Watch how the majesty control it
Don't let it go slow down hold on
Now can I get a witness shout Hallelujah, Amen

Smooth, I made it to free your mind to the rhythm

Taking off my shirt and breaking them sweats
Tattoos all over my body 7 on the stomach,
Skull on my chest, Nine millimetre in my pocket
Ready to buck on the crowd,

My word is like a hammer like a shattering rock,
Crack through your heart and take the evil apart

From the end of the earth unto you I call, time and again I fall, back to you I crawl
You have been a refuge for me, a tower of strength in the face of the enemy
Enemy, enemy lines I find I let myself get tied up too many times
You can't have my heart I'm taking back what's mine
I know it lie just smoke in your eye and you saved my soul from the other side

When faint grows my heart to a rock that too hard for me to climb alone lead me
For you have been a refuge

With you I smash a troop and with my G-d I leap over a wall
May the king answer you on the day that you call
Stand tall, battle yawl, the clouds crawl low, all stalled,
Heavens lay draped over New York like a prayer shawl,
The holy one enthroned upon the praises of Israel

And sing her a song
It feels like there's no safe place
In a world that's come apart
And the deafening sound of a bursting bubble
Wakes you up with a start
Is there nowhere that is safe
Why can't we change the rules so I win
All I need is an escape
A temporary place to hide
When she's coming in the door when she's walking out the door
Hard to tell which is worse
That false feeling of relief when she comes in
Or the empty feeling when she's gone
And every night on the streets the forces of darkness
Score another victory
And I stand with the timid waiting for the devil
To make a martyr of me
Fold up the tents and load up the trucks
'Cause it's time to move on
If we only knew where to go
I hope that we'd already be gone
And even when we're lying together, I make sure she falls asleep first
It seems when things are at their best, my mind starts to wander
To things at their worst

Occasional rain

Damn the weatherman
He seems to work against me any way he can
And he's been dealing tear-drops since the world began
And occasional pain

And blue you, don't believe I'm talking to you
The light is shining through you- still you will not see
Blue you- think I'm trying to undo you
When I only want to seek the Truth
And speak true

I can't tell you when
But someday soon we'll see the sun re-born again
And there'll be light without as well as light within
And occasional rain"

The crops failed, the well ran dry
When they lost the watershed

A baby dies, its mother cries, the children gather 'round
They're wondering what the day will bring
Will they be the next one found?

Do you dare to gaze into their hollow eyes, hollow eyes?
Are they staring holes in you with their hollow eyes,
Hollow eyes, hollow eyes?

In the crowded sheds the children lay their heads
To escape the Haitian heat
The hunger pains drive them to the street
Wond'ring if today they'll eat
Some find food in the refuse heap, others find disease
Some find it harder just to live when they can die with ease.

The least of these is hungry.
The least of these is sick.
The least of these needs clothing.
The least of these needs drink.
The least of these knows sorrow.
The least of these knows grief.
The least of these has suffered pain, and Jesus is His name.

Is He staring back at you with His hollow eyes,
Hollow eyes, hollow eyes?"

Drenched in self-righteousness I'm letting go of apathy, I won't put up the front of a victim anymore.
So sick of cheap excuses from everyone I know I'm scattering the ashes of who I was.
Letting go of the person I used to be looking back and laughing at what I once believe.
Escaping the plagues of my life, and letting go of my regret, I'm casting my past in the flood forgetting every line we spent.
With death in my hands I'll clean myself of this. (2x)

I've heard her call to me (The clouds are clinging to your sail)
And smiling in my dreams (The storm is coming, can you see?)
She whispers this:

Follow again one single piece
Of dream afar
Spent my all whole life there,
Chasing the hope

A drive so strong,
So deep I cannot see the end
Inborn sense of finding
What's beyond, in the furious storm

Reunifying with air and soil I am part of
Distant yet so close!

Longing for a whisper
That would carry me away
Faced my ultimate desire that was swirling
Through the mazes of my mind

Watch my gold,
It can be never bought or sold
Made up and collected through the years
From emotions and dreams

A noble line I carry on
Exploring the ways I never saw

Longing for a whisper
That would carry me away
Faced my ultimate desire that was swirling
Through the mazes of my mind

(Solo: Aydan)
(Melody: Jarpen / Regality: both)

Reunifying with air and soil I am part of
Distant yet so close!

Longing for a whisper
That would carry me away
Faced my ultimate desire that was swirling
Through the mazes of my mind
If you were given chance to fly would you
Retain your tears of joy
Pushed as far as any wind will go,
A fiery stride to the sun

Clearing my path from anything
That leads me to a fall
On the brink of loneliness, I faced
The illusion of leaving from the flock
On this one way trail to unfolding new

Follow me into a solo get in the flow
And you can picture like a photo
Music mixed mellow maintains to make
Melodies for MC's motivates the breaks
I'm everlastin, I can go on for days and days
With rhyme displays that engrave deep as X-rays
I can take a phrase that's rarely heard,
FLIP IT - now it's a daily word
I can get iller than 'Nam, a killin' bomb
But no alarm - Rakim will remain calm
Self-esteem make me super superb and supreme
But for a microphone still I fiend
This was a tape I wasn't supposed to break
I was supposed to wait, but let's motivate
I want to see who can keep followin and swallowin
Takin' the making, bitin it and borrowin
Brothers tried and others died to get the formula
But I'ma let ya sweat - you still ain't warm
You a step away from frozen, stiff as if ya posin
Dig into my brain as the rhyme gets chosen
So follow me and were ya thinkin' you were first?
Let's travel at magnificent speeds around the Universe
What could ya say as the Earth gets further and further away
Planets are small as balls of clay
Astray into the Milky Way - world's outasight
Far as the eye can see - not even a satellite
Now stop and turn around and look
As ya stare in the darkness, ya knowledge is took!
So keep starin' soon ya suddenly see a star
You better follow it 'cause it's the R
This is a lesson if ya guessin and if ya borrowin
Hurry hurry step right up and keep followin
The Leader

Verse Two:

This is a lifetime mission, vision of prison
Aight listen
In this journey you're the journal I'm the journalist
Am I Eternal? Or an eternalist?
I'm about to flow long as I can possibly go
Keep ya movin cause the crowd said so
Dance - cuts rip ya pants
Eric B on the blades, bleedin to death - call the ambulance
Pull out my weapon and start to squeeze
A magnum as a microphone murderin' MC's
Let's quote a rhyme from a record I wrote
(Follow the leader) Yeah - dope
Cause every time I stop it seems ya stuck
Soon as ya try to step off ya self-destruct
I came to overcome before I'm gone
By showin and provin and lettin knowledge be born
Then after that I'll live forever - you disagree?
You say never? Then follow me!
From century to century you'll remember me
In history - not a mystery or a memory
God by nature, mind raised in Asia
Since you was tricked, I have to raise ya
From the cradle to the grave,
But remember - You're not a slave
'Cause we was put here to be much more than that
But we couldn't see it because our mind was trapped
But I'm here to break away the chains, take away the pains
Remake the brains, reveal my name
I guess nobody told you a little knowledge is dangerous
It can't be mixed, diluted; it can't be changed or switched
Here's a lesson if ya guessing and borrowing
Hurry hurry, step right up and keep following
The leader

Verse Three:

A furified freestyle, lyrics of fury
My third eye makes me shine like jewelry
You're just a rent-a-rapper, your rhymes are minute-maid
I'll be here when it fade to watch you flip like a renegade
I can't wait to break and eliminate
On every traitor or snake - so stay awake
And follow and follow, because the tempo's a trail
The stage is a cage, the mic is a third rail
I'm Rakim the Fiend of a Microphone
I'm not HIM, so leave my mic alone
Soon as the beat is felt, I'm ready to go
So fasten your seatbelt, 'cause I'm about to flow
No need to speed slow down to let the leader lead
Word to daddy, indeed!
The R's a rollin' stone, so I'm rollin'
Directions is told, then the rhymes are stolen
Stop buggin', a brother said, dig em, I never dug 'em
He couldn't follow the leader long enough so I drug 'em
Into danger zone, he should arrange his own
Face it, it's basic, erase it, change ya tone
There's one R in the alphabet
It's a one-letter word and it's about to get
More complex from one rhyme to the next
Eric B be easy on the flex
I've been from state to state, followers tailgate
Keep comin' but you came too late, but I'll wait
So back up, regroup, get a grip, come equipped
You're the next contestant - clap ya hands, you won a trip!
The price is right - don't make a deal too soon
How many notes could you name this tune?
Follow the Leader is the title, theme, task
Now ya know, you don't have to ask
Rap is Rhythm And Poetry, cuts create sound effects
You might catch up if you follow the records E. wrecks
Until then keep eatin and swallowin
You better take a deep breath and keep followin
The leader."

Polluted death is coming, do you care?

Garbage going nowhere
Soon the dumps will spread to your front door
Lakes and rivers stagnant
Nothing lives or grows like years before
Nature's disappearing
The world you take for granted ... soon no more

Read about pollution
Make manufacturers uncomfortable
Boycott at the market
Containers that are non-returnable
Aluminum, glass or plastic
Eternal waste that's not destructible

We're of a generation
That may live out our natural time
But as for all our children?
Born to suffocate in human slime

Carols being sung by the tree
Window's candlelight shining bright
For the whole world to see

Children's eyes of sweet expectations
Wondering what each present will hold
Lying in their beds and impatient
On long Christmas Eves of old

It used to be that all the family
Would gather for this one night
It used to be that special feeling
Shared together knowing
Christmas was here
One night a year

How I miss that old-fashioned Christmas
Memories that last through the years
Call me sentimental, don't mind if you do
I wish an old fashioned Christmas to you"

Quiero complacerme el gusto
Sobre el tibio de tu templo

Quiero secar mis antojos

I want to be a forester
Run through the moss on high heels

Waiting for it to come back to me

When I grow up
I want to live near the sea
Crab claws and bottles of rum
That's what I'll have
Staring at the seashell
Waiting for it to embrace me

I put my soul in what I do
Last night I drew a funny man
With dog eyes and a hanging tongue
It goes way bad
I never like that sad look
From someone who wants to be loved by you

I'm very good with plants
When my friends are away
They let me keep the soil moist
On the seventh day I rest
For a minute or two
Then back on my feet to call for you

You've got cucumbers on your eyes
Too much time spent on nothing
Waiting for a moment to arise
The face in the ceiling
And arms too long
I'm waiting for him to catch me

Waiting for it to embrace me oh"

With cotton candy in your one hand and your other hadn in mine

We've come a long way through the years had our fair share of heartache and tears

We've had our ups and downs and turn arounds but our love was stronger than any fight
Even when we lost control we never let go we kept on hangin' on for dear life
I know no matter the size of the mountain you and me will be side by side
Baby ain't life and love one big rollercoaster ride

Back in the day we were cool and crazy like two outlaws on the run
Now making love means making babies and I swear we're having twice the fun
It's been no walk in the park but then again that's not our style
It wouldn't be too entertaining without a little drama every once in awhile

From a valley unseen
Out of the depths of a trembling heart
You find yourself starting to sing

Let the chorus build louder and louder
And shatter the blackness and pain
Let it rise like a healing flame

What they were
They are haloed in anger, bitter
And hurt
And it's not so you'd notice but
It's a sinister thing
Like the wheels of ambition at
The christening

So I went out walking on the
Streets of the dead
With a chip on my shoulder
And a voice in my head
It said you have been brought here
Though you don't know what for

Well the mystery train is coming
Right to your door

And I hear you calling, you
Don't have to call so loud
I see you falling and you don't
Have to walk so proud
You can run all night but we
Can take you where
You can cry like an angel

There were high school night dances
When we played stump the band
We were raising each other
In a strange land
There were hard pills to swallow
But we drank 'em all down
Oh the nights were too short then
And now they're a little too long

I hear you calling and you
Don't have to call so loud
I see you falling and you don't
Have to walk so proud
You can run all night but we
Can take you where
You can shout out in anger
You can laugh like a fool
You can cry like an angel

So look homeward baby
Keep your eyes on the sky
They will never forgive you
So don't ask them to try
This is your party, I know
It's not your ideal
May we all find salvation
In professions that heal

I hear you calling, you
Don't have to call so loud
I see you falling and you don't
Have to walk so proud
You can run all night but we
Can take you where
You can shout out an answer
You can laugh like a fool

You can call up to heaven
We'll be listening to you
You can sing hallelujah
You can fly like a bird
You can cry like angel
When there are no words"

Der Lorbeerkranz, ein neuer Tanz
Schwingt Rhythmus in die Hüften der Stadt
Man sieht und kennt und sagt sich
Was diese Nacht zu sagen hat

Fragt nicht nach neuen, alten Werten
Seht weißes Licht, seht nur Gefühl
Die Nacht gehört uns bis zum Morgen
Wir spielen jedes Spiel

Lass diese Reise niemals enden
Das Tun kommt aus dem Sein allein
Allein aus Dimensionen, die
Illusionen und Sensationen lohnen

Give me more
Give me more
Give me more
Give me more
Give me more
Give me more
Give me more

Junge Römer - tanzen anders als die andern
Sie lieben ihre Schwesternliebe lieber als den Rest der Welt
Frag junge Römer - kennt ihr die Sonne noch?
Sie kennt die Sorgen
Junge Römer - die Nacht ist jung wie ihr
Vergesst das Morgen

Un ballo nuovo porta ritmo nei fiancho della citt'
Ci vendiamo, trovimo, chiediamo che cosa si fa
Ma non cercate die volori, e magari sensation
La notte e'nostra fin al mattino abbiamo illusion
No E'la fine del viaggino, ce' sempre un domani e
Ci sono dimensioni, con illusioni e sensazioni

Give me more ...

Young romans - there is a night before each day
And that price is still to pay
Never stop this old erosion phantastic voyage

Junge Römer...

Junge Römer - kennt ihr die Sonne noch
Die Nacht ist jung wie ihr und doch
Im Land wo jeder Traum gelandet ist - man vergisst

Exposed my vulnerable side, had me open wide
Said you forever keep it real, but you lied
Was the first to feel inside, the Ill Na Na
Had me thirst when you whispered to me, ""How it feel mama?""
Yeah, but don't hurt it, I like the way you work it
No Diggity, don't stop get busy
Blew up your pager, checked your clothes
Duked your house keys, stole your beeper code
What happened to the Mo's and the occasional roses
Massages and the bubble baths, rubbin my toes as
I realize you was just misleadin me
I shoulda known, you left your last chick to be with me

Mommy dearest tried to prepare us for a lot ahead
You never heard, preferred to smoke your lye instead
On the one to one combo told me you'd die for bread
That's why I spend these nights, cryin in the bed
You had the deep dish six, your rep was widespread
I tried to intervene you said it was over my head
Said I'd never understand the plight of a black man
Right, but I'm tryin' to keep you in my life
V.I.A. satellite, talkin' them burn outs
Soon you had me whylin and you turned me out
Taught me bout how to win, the code of the streets
Luxuries and wealth untold it was sweet
And one night you asleep after work was chopped up
Felt somethin' strange in my veins, I popped up
One foot in the house shoot flew to the horn
Got the cell operator, I knew you was gone"

Your sighs of secret pain
Pretending and inventing
Just to hide your shame
Plastic smiles and faces
Blinkin' back the tears
Empty friends and places
All magnify your fears

If you're tired and weary
Weak and heavy laden
I can understand how
It feels to be alone
I will take your burden
If you'll let Me love you
Wrap My arms around you
Give your heart a home

It hurts to watch you struggle
And try so hard to win
But trade your precious birth rite
For candy coated sin
Wasting priceless moments
Restless and confused
Building up defenses
For fear that you'll be used

If you're tired and weary
Weak and heavy laden
I can understand how
It feels to be alone
I will take your burden
If you'll let Me love you
Wrap My arms around you
Give your heart a home

Take My yolk upon you
And walk here by My side
Let Me heal your heartaches
And dry the tears you've cried
Never will I leave you
Never turn away
Keep you through the darkness
Lead you through the day

If you're tired and weary
Weak and heavy laden
I can understand how
It feels to be alone
I will take your burden
If you'll let Me love you
Wrap My arms around you
Give your heart a home

es perdonarme tu y comprenderte yo

es buscar un lugar donde escuchar tu voz
el amor es crear un mundo entre los dos
es perdonarme tu y comprenderte yo

El amor,
es una gota con sabor a miel
es una lluvia en el atardecer

Check this out
Hey, I knew this nigga named Johnnie Walker
A nightstalker, a big shit-talker
Even though he liked a lot of vodka (say what?)
He was from Tennessee, sprung off Hennessey
Makin' enemies fast - in L.A.N. they didn't play (what?)
He got into a Tanque/tangle with +Ray+, he had on too much gray
Ray had a Strawberry sister named Daquiri
Johnnie politely her ass behind the back three
Now, all four uncles E&amp;J wanna tossi
Martini and Rossi had to get the niggaz off me
He got jacked for his Dana's, in other words
(Give it up nigga, give it up!)
He caught the Nighttrain and blasted his Thunderbird
With the pistol, him and Cisco, couldn't stand him
'Cause he caught him lickin' Brandy off his sister named Kandi
At this point he had more bad luck than a trash truck
He lost his girl, Remi spent his last buck up
Remi caught him shootin game at Elayne, so now
Flowers and champagne don't mean a damn thang
Remi ended up runnin' off with Martin
He was wanted for arson for startin fires in Carson
So Johnnie hired a gun named Rum, and paid him
151 and the job got done
With a thirty-eight straight to the face
He caught him in a six-pack and got they ass back
Up close he made 'em post and broke all their glasses
(?) And Rum threatened their families with matches
He felt he needed more men just like Gin
So he packed his strap and started claimin Silver Satin
From then on in, anybody caught bailin
Down Seagram's 7 was bound to get sweated
Except Bartyles and James, 'cause they was cool
He knew 'em from school when they didn't bang and made moves
Turns out, he never reached the top
They found his ass at the beach ""on tha rox""

In a crowd of teenagers coming out of the zoo
She stumbled, started to slip and fall
Teeter-tottered on the top of patent leather shoes
I happened to catch her and said
""Maybe these ruby shoes are a little cumbersome for you.""
Maybe for you, now

But not as shaky as I must have seemed
Talking junk through her giggle little teenage dream
And on the phone I could not compete
My dumb luck fake confidence was getting weak
And for a sec', I thought I sounded sweet
But sure enough in a gruff, faint voice
I heard myself speak

I could stay a while
But sooner or later, I'll break your smile
And I can tell a joke
But one of these days, I'm bound to choke

And we could share a kiss
But I feel like I can't go through with this
And I bet we could build a home
But I know the right thing for me to do
Is to leave you alone
Leave you alone, now

I'm beginning to like you
So you probably won't get what I'm going to do
I'm walkin' away from you
It probably don't make much sense to you
But I'm trying to save you
From all of the things that I'll probably say or do
I'll probably do, now

I could stay a while
But sooner or later I'll break your smile
And I can tell a joke
But one of these days, I'm bound to choke

And we might share a kiss
But I feel like I can't go through with this
And I bet we could build a home
But I know the right thing for me to do
Is to leave you alone
Leave you alone, now

You'll probably call me a fool
And say I'm doing exactly what a coward would do
And I'm beginning to like you
It's a shame, what a lame way to live, but what can I do?
I hope you appreciate what I do

Big T and I'm from Chicago
You know I gotta represent the city doe
A nigga fin' to shoot a new video
So I'm fin' to take a trip out to Cali yo
Took a flight, ten of us in a group
Hit the West coast, now I'm fuckin' with Snoop
Told a few hoes to come up to the shoot
And she was lookin' so cold pullin up in the Coupe
Pretty skin tone, a nigga got y'all
Soon as I took a look at them big brown eyes
Fat ass, my dick got hard
Soon as I took a look at the big brown thighs
Too sassy, bet you doin' nasty
And I can tell it when I'm lookin' at the way you walk
Thick lips, ready for suckin
And a nigga wanna fuck you when I listen to the way you talk
I'ma do it like this when I drop at you
Let you know that I'm the Twist' when I pop at you
Comin' at you in the Mission Impossible
Let's go to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles
Then as soon as we leave we gon' have to go and get naughty
Then when I come back (chirrp) (hello?) Whassup shawty?

And if you got me, then I got you


I'm a player, youse a player
We some players, so we should play a
Game, do yo' thang
Ain't it mayne, turn the lights off
Hit the right spot (ooh)

But it can't happen if you ain't real
Don't, you, play with me
Come and spend, the day with me
Everything is everything
Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the dopest of 'em all
Gots to be Big Snoop Dogg
So pick up the phone and answer my call

(Snoop Dogg)
How, long, has it been
Since you had that thang up in
They say Dogg you walk it too much
And you may think I'm talkin' too much
But then again I reminisce
I miss that hug, I miss that kiss
I miss that love
Really 'cause, I miss that bitch

(Twista)
And I love it when you hit that switch
Shorty tell me how you get that thick
Where the fuck did you get that fit
Come and fire the 'dro up let me hit that shit
That's right - had a nigga feelin' so good
That when I had went home
I was thinkin' 'bout you so hard
That I couldn't help but to pick up the phone

And I just had to call ya
I'm lovin' how you look and how you smell
And you got a ass fat as hell
I just had to call ya
Girl I'm lovin' what you do to me
You break me off and then put me to sleep
I just had to call ya
I got a couple things that we can do
Just let me know if I can come through
I just had to call ya

Burning down the highway in a broken down van
Seeing the world through said go nowhere dead end
We are famous
We are brave
And our words will change the world
Today we'll tear open the heartland
Our amps go to eleven and our hearts will beat forever
So here we are, three thousand miles from home
We're all in this together and I never feel alone
Songs are made for singing
Leave loose ends be
Looting super centers cooking in truck stop microwaves
Sleeping on bottles of piss and the floors of the gracious

From here on out it's all compromise

Siempre un último tiempo,

Sin medir cuanto se da,
Una voz que se quiebra,
Cuando el corazón se va.

Decir adiós,
A ese tiempo que ya nunca volverá,
Decir adiós,

Lively up yourself
You rock so, you rock so

You rock so, you rock so
You dip so, you dip so
You skank so, you skank so, and don't be no drag
You come so, you come so, for reggae is another bag

Get what you got that bag

What you say you got

And left a note at your bedside 
I'm far too shy to speak to you at school 
You leave me numb, and I'm not sure why 

I find it easier to sit and stare 
Than push my limbs out towards you right there 
My heart is bursting in your perfect eyes 
As blue as oceans and as pure as skies 

I struggle for the words and then give up 
My head's up with the birds on the T hut 
A little peace of mind that I know better 
Than the plain disgrace of all my letters 

But after that the floodgates opened up 
And I fell in love with everyone I saw 
Please take your time, I'm not in any rush 
And it's in everything I ever write 

It's not as if I need the extra weight 
Confused enough by life, so thanks a lot 
Lonely written words for company 
Just raise the roof this once and follow me 

I struggle for the words and then give up 
My head's up with the birds on the T hut 
A little peace of mind that I know better 
Than the plain disgrace of all my letters"

To see the earth through painted eyes?
To look through panes of shaded glass
See the stains of winter's grass?

So make your way on down to the sea

Can you now return to from where you came?
Try to burn your changing name
Or with silver spoons and colored light
Will you worship moons in winter's night?

Born with our senses keen, hope and fear
With a sense of danger and demise
The world will numb everything, hope and fear
A negative discipline, a vacuum

What evil force dragged them down?
What demon singled them out?
What evil took them away?
Allowing only two choices

So tell me
Was there a secret never shared with others?
Was there a hidden trauma?
What made the bonds break?
What caused the mistakes?
Why was the criminal life so desired?

Born with our senses keen, hope and fear
With a sense of danger and demise
The world will numb everything, hope and fear
A negative discipline, a vacuum

From afar, bleak reports trickle in
But the world has spread apart, the world has spread apart
All the promise that was held now is wasted
The soul is delicate, the walls have crippled it
From afar, troubled lives lose their purpose
The world has given up, the world has given up
The world has finally forsaken its sons

""I'm not sure anymore...""

And now, amidst the waves and the cloudless skies
That'd blanket the year before
I watch my life wash ashore

Have you ever been a part of something 
That you thought would never end
And then of course it did?
Have you ever felt the weight inside you
Pulling away inside your skin
And then something had to give?

Now the lines are drawn
Is this feeling gone?
The best parts of this have come and gone
And now there is all this is
With the reasons clear
We'll spend another year
Without direction, full of fear
But now things will be different

There's nothing simple when it comes to you and I
There's always something in this everchanging life
And there probably always will
Now that time is getting harder to come by
The same arguments are always on our mind
We've killed this slowly fading light

Now the lines are drawn
Is this feeling gone?
The best parts of this have come and gone
And now there is all this is
With the reasons clear
We'll spend another year
Without direction, full of fear
But now things will be different

And now something 
Has kept me here too long
And you can't leave me 
If i'm already gone

Well now something (hey) 
Has kept me here too long
And you can't leave me (hey)

Now let's say that something (hey) 
Has kept me here too long
And you can't leave me (hey)

Make the same mistakes, we're always hanging on
Break those promises we're always leaning on

When I rock the mic you got to like the way I operate
I make miracles happen just from rappin'
I'm so lyrically potent and I'm flowin' and explodin'

On the scene mean I got the potential
To make you go then chill
I got the credentials that is of which I chose
To make a rhyme and chill then you know

I will fulfill to make a couple of mill
As I build a guild for all the rappers and skills
And kill the weak rappers and no thrills
Hang 'em an ephigy if he's a sucker

Hang 'em to the left of me 'cause my right hand man
Is my mic stand and the microphone that I own
And my game plan is keeping at a steady pace
Ain't no need for a rush it ain't no race

I'ma hit the top just when I wanna
And it's a matter of time and I'm gonna
'Cause I know when to go 'head enter
The classic Moe Dee rap that sent ya

Runnin' around holdin' ya head
Askin' ya homeboy yo man
You hear what he said another funky rhythm
Look at ya man and give him a high five

'Cause I'm live runnin' around with him
Telling everybody hanging out on the block
It's time to wake up and check the clock
Punch it I go to work, I go to work
I go to work like an architect

I build a rhyme some times it climbs so erect
Skyscrapers look like atoms
Cars electrons rollin' in patterns
Writing out word after word

With each letter it becomes visibly better
'Cause my foundation built a nation of rappers
And after I came off vacation I came to roam the land I own
And stand alone on the microphone daddy's home

Open the door playtime is over
Time to go to work and show the
Suckers in the place who run their face
The base and a taste of who's the ace

Start the race I'm coming in first
With each verse I build a curse
So rappers can't capture Moe Dee's rapture
After I got ya I have to slap ya

Senseless with endless rhymes don't pretend this
Is anything short of stupendous
And when this rhyme is done your mind will become
So trapped in the rap you'll lust on another one
You gotta wait it takes time

I don't write I build a rhyme
I draw plans draft the diagrams
An architect in effect and it slams
And if it's weak when I'm done
Renovate and build another one

I go to work I go to work I go to work like a boxer
Train the brain and aim to out fox ya
Like a punch my rhyme knocks ya
Some times it rocks ya

So hard it stops ya dead in your tracks
So power packed before you can react
You're flat on your back down for the count
Get up and dismount 'cause I'm coming
With an endless amount of words in a hurry like a flurry

A collage to camouflage the power punch but don't worry
Knowledge is an antidote I got hand of smoke
Writing at the speed of light with insight
I wrote rhymes at a level so you can't relate unless you're intelligent

So stay awake sleepwalkers slick talkers
This time a native New Yorker's
Riding a crescendo wave to save the mental
State of the fan so he can understand my pencil

Rhymes in its highest form I'm a drop it on ya like a bomb
When it explodes I'll blow up a few casualties but so what
If you're slow you blow you know you go I flow
I throw all pro I go to work I go to work To say rap is not work

Is ludicrous whoever said it must be new to this
When you hear me you'll compare me to a prophet for profit not merely
Putting words together for recreation each rhyme's a dissertation
You wanna know my occupation, I get paid to rock the nation
I go to work, I go to work, I go to work"

Tear at flesh and rip at skin and smash at doubt, I have to break you, fury drives my vicious blows, I see you fall but still I strike you
Again and again your body falls, the movement is sharp and clear and pure and gone, I stop and kneel beside you, drained of everything but pain
Screaming throw myself in fury, over the edge and into your blood

Kiss you once and see you writhe. Hold you close and hear you cry
Kiss your eyes and finish your life. Kiss your eyes. Finish your life

Shouting in my head,
Things that were bright yellow,
Are now black instead

The rope's too tight around my hands
I don't want to understand
Obscured by light, a stain inside
Even your tattooed cross
Is too heavy to bear

Angels sing that closing hymn to me
Can't you hear
Those angels sing the closing hymn to me

Don't have time for letters or long distance calls
If friend you leave then friend you're dead to me

Everybody goes through some changes in life
Some poeple change for the better, some poeple change for the worse
But umm, some people need to make that change

Why would I change?
I ain't never slide down a bad pole
Even though I'm certified over plaques sold
They say I'm different 'cause I ride in a plat. Rolls
But every time, we gotta ride don't this cat roll?
I never snitch and go and hide in a rat hole
And I ain't givin' you nothing besides what this gat hold
No pride, I ain't that old
Cut off a few, but kept a few girls I decide like I'm Matt Knowles
It probably don't seem like a struggle
But I used to dream that this thug'll balance beams just to smuggle
It's funny same girls that didn't seem like they'd love you
Is beggin' for your autographs ands screamin' to hug you
It's crazy, same dudes that seem like they thug you
Is prayin' on your downfall, schemin' to mug you
And people that didn't give a fuck, is dreamin' to bug you
And goin' through' extreme's just to plug you, who really changed?

This game ain't change me, so don't let it change you

Why would I change?
I ain't stepped outside of Superman's phone booth
To remind where I'm from, I look at my own tooth
I'm speaking the known truth
I ain't been living the same since I moved under the Sylvia Rhone's roof
Why would I feel like I'm a stranga
And why should I feel like I'm in danga
And I grind until I'm right
Whether it's on the streets or online tryna climb sites
I ain't blind from the limelight
I had my mind and my rhymes tight and sign when the time's right
People shouldn't be hateful, they should be grateful
But fuck it, I guess I gotta keep my .38 full
I'm playing the game like I'm supposed
Staying the same like I'm supposed
Ghetto Fab in the house! Hip-hop hustler
1 million customers and still bust at ya

This game ain't change me, so don't let it change you
If you've been real with me, I'm still real with you
If you got love for me, I still got love for you
If you down for me, then I'm still down for you
If you don't fuck with me, then I don't fuck with you
If you ain't cool with me, then I ain't cool with you
If you don't ride for me, then I won't ride for you
This game ain't change me, don't let it change you

Why would I change when I get green like the Incredible Hulk?
I've chilled with the richest people to the ghetto-est folks
Known a few dime moves and met a few Locs
Made a few comments and said a few jokes
But it's gettin' me sick, someone prescribe me some medicine
Before the fame, the vibe was way better then
Some have even became rivals instead of friends
Only two become liable for settlements
I grew up watchin the Bed-Stuy with some veterans
Now they hate to see a nigga drivin' the better Benz
That's why the clubs be, deprivin' to let us in
They know the family bring knives and barettas in
I'm thankful for being allowed, fans for being the crowd
How could my head be in the clouds?
It's strange, what the fame'll do
But you know what? The only one who seen the change from the fame is you

This game ain't change me, so don't let it change you
If you've been real with me, I'm still real with you
If you got love for me, I still got love for you
If you down for me, then I'm still down for you
If you don't fuck with me, then I don't fuck with you
If you ain't cool with me, then I ain't cool with you
If you won't ride for me, then I won't ride for you
This game ain't change me, don't let it change you

I'm the same nigga man
Same nigga, that ridin' with you

'Cause sunlight is dancing in your eyes
And time is frozen but somehow flying by
Here with your hand holding mine

It just feels right kissing on a Sunday
I'll hold you tight as if it were the last day
With all my might, I will keep the world away
It just feels right kissing you on a Sunday

Time is racing to the sound of my heart beating
Can the dreaming escape this life
Unfair, maybe, but know that I'm not leaving
Right now, baby, life is kind

Make this moment last for a lifetime
Don't let it slip away
Play it over and over like your favorite song
And we'll fit forever in a day"

Todos los ríos van al mar
pero éste nunca se llenará.

Todos los ríos
siempre volverán a donde salieron,
para comenzar a correr de nuevo.
Lo que siempre fue lo mismo será,
lo que siempre hicieron repetirán.

No olvidar,
lo que ves ya se ha visto ya.
Tal vez un día lo sabrás
todo tiene un tiempo bajo el sol.

Porque habrá siempre
tiempo de plantar y de cosechar,
tiempo de hablar, también de callar.
Hay tiempo para guerra y tiempo de paz
tiempo para el tiempo y un rato más.

Buenas y malas son,
cosas que vivo hoy.
No es ésta tierra, no
sueño color azul.
¿No es quizás que no sé mirar?
Cuanto, cuanto hay a mi alrededor,
más de lo que mis ojos pueden mirar
y llegar a ver.
Estas son razones que dicen que:
Sólo sé,
que sé querer.
Y que tengo Dios
y tengo fe.
Y que doy amor

Sé que en algún lugar
alguien me espera hoy.
Sé que ahora tengo yo

You were seventeen
You were half my age
The youth I'd never seen
Unlikely people meeting in a dream
Heaven only knows the way it should have been 

Here today my tomorrow
Where you lead I will follow
All that kissing
No passion missing
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye 
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye 
Come live with me

Dinner parties followed
And all my age implies
My friends began to talk
I began to realise
If half the things they say
Are quarter true of me
Then how can I eclipse the youth
You gave to set me free 

There was something in your smile
That was hard to reconcile
The time had come to testify to reason
Though years will not erase
Remembrance of those days
At least there's no submission to hearts treason 

Here today my tomorrow
No more shame only sorrow
All that kissing
There's something missing
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye 
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye 
Come live with me

Now there's nothing left to cry for
And there's nowhere left to go
Just another hopeless fight
But how were we to know
The strong are sometimes wrong
But the weak are never free
The choice we made we can't evade
Don't try to follow me 

Here today my tomorrow
No more pain only sorrow
All that kissing
There's something missing
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye

En el ardor de una noche romántica
Mis aullidos son el llamado 
Yo quiero un lobo domesticado

Por fin he encontrado un remedio infalible que borre del todo la culpa 
No pienso quedarme a tu lado mirando la tele y oyendo disculpas
La vida me ha dado un hambre voraz y tú apenas me das caramelos 
Me voy con mis piernas y mi juventud por ahí aunque te maten los celos

Para dejar la manada frenética
La luna llena como una fruta
No da consejos ni los escucha

Llevo conmigo un radar especial para localizar solteros 
Si acaso me meto en aprietos también llevo el número de los bomberos
Ni tipos muy lindos ni divos ni niños ricos yo sé lo que quiero
Pasarla muy bien y portarme muy mal en los brazos de algún caballero

Ya está sentada en su mesa y pone la mira en su próxima presa

Way up on the summer range.
Found a place to make my bed
As the evening shadows spread
Beyond the campfire light,
In the stillness of night,
Came the call of a coyote choir,
And the song
Of the wind in the wire.

As it strummed the rusted strings,
It sang of long-forgotten things.
Many moons and many suns
Of the real Americans.
When the arrow and the bow
Stalked the range
Of the buffalo,
And the call of the coyote choir
Knew no song
Of the wind in the wire.

As the ghostly balladeer
Hypnotized me, I could hear
Bugle calls, and battle cries.
Broken promises and lies.
The spirits of the plain
Still sing their sad refrain
In the call of the coyote choir
And the song
Of the wind in the wire."

And soon the Firebrand he'd secure
Until he met at Glenmalure

See all the children of the Gael

Crow out upon, an Irish rock?
Fly up and teach him manners

The garden swells with a thousand more wise
Forever flung to celestial dreams
Clawing at the grave of the dead Nazarene

I watch the storm approaching
The darkness calls my name
The trees are growing restless
They feel the season change
Their fruit has putrefied
Forbidden once and bound to die
The thread of life lies severed
On the brink of paradise

Grinning winds of hate unfurled
Towers tall that grip the sun
Talons stretch 'neath her veil
Reclamation, our time has come
Our time has come

Autumn spreads its golden wings
And lays the path for those unseen
A tangled web of evil spun at last
Winter spawn from barren thighs
To readdress, to slay the blind
And throw the reins untethered to the skies

They pray to the full moon rising
Diana moving with such infinite grace
Wrapped alone in a blanket of nightfall
How many secrets can they read by your face?

Will they know of majesty
Of beauty held in dream-dead sleep
And scarlet seas that bleed the frozen shores?
Will their God of bridled love
Assuage our rule from planes above
Or shrink in fear from chaos roused for war?

War!

Wrest askew the nails
That have held you, lurking deep
September prayers are waning
Burn the shrines of fettered sheep
Spearhead the insurrection
Of a world that seeks no end
We are what we are, what we shall be, again
Again

Appear; draped in terror
To the comfort of your kin
Stain the milky sunset red
And let the others

Summer's dying"

Because we used the clubs to play air guitar
Oh we used the clubs to play air guitar

The beats hittin' you
Just like a home run
Slammin' like a slam dunk
Riding the wave that James Brown gave funk
It happened to James, like it happened to me
How you think I feel to see another MC
Gettin' paid, usin' my rap style
And I'm playin' the background meanwhile
I ain't with that
You can forget that
You took my style
I'm takin' it back
I'm come back like ""Return of the Jedi""

Could only rock rhymes
Only rock crowds
But never rock records

Now brothers are riding me
Like a pony
I'm no phony
I'm the only real micaroni
Playin' the mic like it's supposed to be played
New jacks, you all shoulda stayed out of the business
What is this, amateur night at the Apollo?
Get off this stage, I'm in a rage
I'm like a lion that's been trapped in a cage
I'm the real king, rap is a jungle
I never understood, how could one go
To a party, watch me, stand around and jock me
Become a rapper, then try to rock me
Scheming like a demon, you're screamin' and dreamin'
I'm from the old school, I used to see men
Dies for less, but I'm not living that way
I'll let my mic do the talkin'
And let the music play

And I'm a Picasso
But of course
Why else would you try so
Hard to paint a picture, and try to get ya
Self in my shoes, but they won't fit ya
I'm bigger and better, forget about deffer
Every time I rocked the mic, I left a
Stain in your brain that will remain
Stuck in the back of your brain till you see me
Again, respect, I come correct
The rhymes I select are nothing short of
Vernacular's pure and I can insure
Life od death with my breath, my voice is a cure
I heal life from the words I spread
I'll make a sick man rock on his death bed
Sucker MC's, I'll make your girl say ""ow""
She's jockin'

How ya like me now

It irked my nerve
When I heard
A sucker rapper that I know I'll serve
Run around town sayin' he is the best
Is that a test?
I'm not impressed
Get real, you're nothin' but a toy
Don't ya know I'll serve that boy
Just like a waiter
Hit'em with a place of
These fresh rhymes and
Make sure that he
Pays the bill, and leave him standin' still
When he's had enough, hit him with a refil
And for dessert it won't be no ice cream
I'm just gonna splatter and shatter his pipe dream
Make him feel the wrath, beat him and laugh
Then when I finish them, I'm gonna ask him
Who's the bests, and if he don't say Moe Dee
I'll take my whip and make him call himself Toby
Put him on punishment just like a child, then ask

How ya like me now

Whip him good, then I'll make him sweat
Talkin' about battles and never had a battle yet
But if we ever did
How could you beat me
You're so petrified
Even scared to meet me
My word's the law
That's why you don't beef
You're nothing but a punk, track star, and a thief
So I'm puttin' you on punishment
Just like a child
Never touch another mic

How ya like me now
How ya like me now

I could continue
There's more on the menu
But relax 'cause I'm so far in you
You had enough
I know you're overstuffed
If I keep going
You'll be throwin' up
Old rhymes I used to say
Back in the day
When you used to me
To my parties and pay
Nobody's ever gonna rack me
This I vow
So all I wanna say is

Leads all the women around on a string,
When they go out, they get a million thrills,
But the lovely senoritas wind up with the bills.

People want to see him when he comes their way,
He spreads so much joy everywhere he goes,
Everyone shouts ""Viva la Mexican Joe.""
He likes to gamble, at poker he's an ace,
He's always lucky with the cards that got a face,
At winning the money, he is sure a whiz,
But when they win they don't collect
'Cause they don't know where he is.

He don't no income tax 'cause he don't got no dough,
Still he gets along just fine, how we'll never know,
He's got everything he wants, a girl, a drink, a song,
If we use his formula, we surely can't go wrong.
His favorite playground is anywhere there's girls,
He's got that somethin' that sets their hearts a-whirl,
It couldn't be his money 'cause he ain't got a peso,
But when he wants a kiss all he's got to do is say so

Everybody's looking for a little more air
Crossing all the borders just to take their share
Planning for the future

And we're so abused, and we're so confused
It's easy to believe that someone's going to light the fuse
Can't happen here, can't happen here
All that you fear, they're telling you can't happen here

Supersonic planes for a holiday boom
Rio de Janeiro in an afternoon
People out of work but there's people on the moon
Looking for the future

Concrete racetracks nationwide
Juggernauts carving up the countryside
Cars by the million on a one-way ride
Using up the future

And we're so abused, and we're so confused
It's easy to believe that someone's going to light the fuse
Can't happen here, can't happen here
All that you fear, they're telling you can't happen here

Satellites spying for the C.I.A.
The K.G.B. and the men in grey
Wonder if I'm going to see another day
Somewhere in the future

We got everything we need for a peaceful time
Take what you want but you can't take mine
Everybody's living on the Siegfried line
Worried 'bout the future

And we're so abused, and we're so confused

Easy to believe someone's going to light the fuse

Is now sounding like the man I was hoping
To be
I keep on keeping it real
Cause it keeps getting easier, he'll see
He's the reason that I'm laughing
Even if there's no one else
He said, you've got to love yourself

You say, you shouldn't mumble when you speak
But keep your tongue up in your cheek
And if you stumble on to something better
Remember that it's humble that you seek
You got all the skill you need
Individuality
You got something
Call it gumption
Call it anything you want
Because when you play the fool now
You're only fooling everyone else
You're learning to love yourself

Yes you are, you are, it's you...

When you give and what you take
That's why it's easy to thank you

Yeah! Our shit be always right
Every move you'll see how it's related

(Busta)
Genesis, Genesis, Genesis

(Busta)
Genesis, Genesis, Genesis

While we continuously stay sculpturin bombs
Love unconditional greetings with opening arms
And for my worthy niggaz I'ma die tryin' for y'all
With the blessing of an angel's tear cryin' for y'all
Back to the foundation, takin' you under back where it all started
With a whole new beginnin and a brand new hunger
Starvin to where my skin was suffocatin my ribs
Now we got bitches interior decoratin my crib
Touch the love I got like you holdin' my heart in my hand
And watch my manifesto, shit was all a part of the plan
The fashion that I choose to deal with this shit
Sometimes it's so hard to describe the passion that I feel for this shit
How many struggles I survived just to eat this meal
Never thought y'all meet a nigga that could be this real
Flipmode up in this bitch now let me make you aware
Too late for turnin' back my nigga 'cause we takin' it there

(Busta Rhymes)
Genesis, Genesis, Genesis
And leave!

And leave a mark until it's deep in the floor
Y'all niggaz fucked up never should've let let me get my feet in the door
And then I step through, FUCK wipin my feet at the door
I be the deacon I'm beatin' niggaz and speakin' the raw
Strictly raw shit is what niggaz be seekin' me for
Testin my strength, that's what the devil's try to weaken me for
C'mon, yes and y'all off to the next step... for sure
Rep and make you wanna accept more
Niggas analyze the jewel that I reveal in a rhyme
I'm like somethin' that has evolved about a million times
Peep the display with all the new features
The way we really doin' it, these mu'fuckas probably wouldn't believe us
Flipmode Squad by all means, a pledge of allegiance
With the great feelin' of people like the comin' of Jesus
While a lot of other niggaz don't be tellin' you nothin'
That be the same bullshit that's always pushin my buttons
Godly is how we rep this undeniable force
You like a weak preacher, swearin smacked dead on a cross
Kick niggaz like the two back legs of a horse
Chop ya fingers for tryin' to put your hands in the sauce
Sometimes I think that it would be best if you run
And do yourself a favor, cause you got your whole life ahead of you son!
A whole new thang startin for me
Smell so much ass in a spot, the beat got the world fartin for me
When I spit you know I always love to garnish it hard
While you love-it hate-it niggaz trying to tarnish the God
I know some dudes that would love to bring the hatred to y'all
While I continue to bless you with shit that's is sacred to y'all
Even if I had to bend you in place
I always put it down and rep my niggaz from the most genuine place
From my street corner niggaz to my live niggaz everywhere
Too late for turning back, we takin' it there

4402,TRACMXG12903CA2541.h5,The Winans,Everything You Touch Is a Song,"I think that a song is something more
Than a beautiful melody
To tell the story of truth and reality

I think that a song should be sung by a man
Who knows the meaning of the sorrow
And the meaning of true love

I think that a song should be shared among friends
Then when friends are gone the melody and meaning still lingers on
It tells the good times, it tells of the bad
Tells of when we're happy and when we're sad

Everything You touch is a song
You touched my life one day
(And then)
All of my burdens rolled away

(They rolled away)
You wrote a song that even the bees could hum
Everything You touch is a song, oh, everything

Oh, You touched a bird
(And that's a song)
And that bird started to sing
(Tweet, te, te, de, de)

You went in the jungle and touch a lion
(And that's a song)
And oh, that lion started to roar
(Roar)

You touched a bell
(And that's a song)
That bell started to ring
(Ring a ling)

If you listen real close
Everything thing in nature sings
Oh, everything, everything You touch is a song
Most importantly You touched my life

Oh, I'm mighty grateful You came along and touched my life
You touched my life, I didn't think I could last
But along came Jesus and He just
Laid His whole hand on me

You touched my life
You touched my life
You touched my life

And my burdens just rolled away
(They rolled away)
You wrote a song that the robins could sing along

Everything You touch, everything You touch
Everything You touch, everything You touch

4412,TRAQEOG128F9353981.h5,Martin Sexton,Caught In The Rain,"In a rusted red Chevy with a heart full of glory
She left that night
A suitcase at the door open wide let the cold air come in
And then she asked me for a light

Said she had some old business see an old friend
Or maybe make a new start
But the words of her reason they changed with the season
And the truth burned in my heart

It blew me away and I thought I'd go crazy
'Cause I knew even then I was caught

I'm caught in the rain again
I pray to the Heavens to defend me
I'm caught in the rain
Why's it seem like more rain that they send me?

So I listen to the wind for the answer
Time hangs heavy on my face
I run from the storm that's on it's way
Until I find there is no place

No person, no thing I can run to, no shelter I can gain from the rain
Yes I know this time it's too late, now

'Cause I'm caught in the rain again
And I pray to the Heavens to defend me
I'm caught in the rain
Why's it seem like more rain that they send me? And they send me

And the rain comes down so silently
And time stand's still like it's in front of me
And the years turn to the rain
And this silence kills me

So now in this one horse town bar
I sing in the back room in the December night
Here she comes through the doorway
With a blustering wind that's too cold to forget

She looks like she knew me
The heat shot through me, melted me down
So we sat and talked about the old days
Or any new things that we found

Talked about the days when we were so much younger and innocent
We saw it plain, we were just caught in the rain

We're caught in the rain again
I pray to the Heavens to defend me
Caught in the rain
Why's it seem like more rain that they send me?

I'm out here on my knees
And my love knows I've been trying
Still I'm caught in the rain on these old fool ideas I'm relying
So I guess she gets me the rain again"

""I'm sorry I blasphemed thy beloved kingdom"" 
With a kiss of grace thou besmear my soul 
Nothingness can now be seen mirrored in my feeble eyes 

This is the coldest hell... 

So now I experience a void I know so well 
A song of emptiness are fed again 
Thorns arise with the breeze of cold insanity 
I am alive but yet so dead 

So fucking dead... 

Written in blood over a wasteland of bones 
Reflected upon a frozen horizon 
Sinister and terminal this hope of desolation 
With a whiff of desecration and hate 

So let my burned out mind fall dead to the ground 
And rape my soul with a demoniacal smile 
Stab these thorns deeper into my heart 
And free me from these depressive thoughts 

Cleanse me...

Of a love light that's beaming

In my arms fondly press you

It was never intended
You're just coquetting
I'd be forgetting
But you are not letting me dear

Rosebud of the days of my childhood
Watched you bloom in the wild wood

(Yeah, though I walk through the valley of rape and despair
With head high and eyes alert, I tread on plane of many
We who are of good nature and intention, but cannot touch on the dark recesses of memory
And pain learned, so come walk with me
Feel the pain and release it)

Can you see the end?
Choke on me, my friend
Must to drown these thoughts
Purity over rot

What the hell am I?
Worn eroded pride
Saddened ten miles wide
I'm gonna let it slide

Sickman, sickman, sickman, sickman

I can feel the wheel but I can't steer
When my thoughts become my biggest fear

Ah, what's the difference, I'll die
Ah, in this sick world of mine

In a house on an island
There's a tale that must be told
Of our mysterious Misty Mountains
Behind all the songs I wrote
Lives an old man and his shadow
And they're whistling day and night
For whatever, whatever it's worth for
They are whistling for you and I

On a ranch in the wildness
There's a song that must be sung
About a blindfolded angel 
Who never learned the right from wrong
And though I don't know enough English
To describe its troubled mind
But for one thing I am certain 
Is that it sings for you and I

And I tried so hard to figure him out 
But I guess I'm only human
I've been watching him, drawing him
Analyzing him in every way
I could possibly think of

But that does not really help me
You gotta sit back and enjoy
You know Ochrasy raised and betrayed him
Now he sits there all alone
With his soul and his legend
And his epic melodies
They are with us when we're crying
And they are with us when we bleed
Yes, they are with us when we're crying 
And they are with us when we bleed"

By Charlie Rich

I've tried so hard my dear to show that you're my every dream.
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme.
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart.
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue.
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do.
In anger, unkind words I said that make the teardrops start.
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

(Cold, cold heart)

There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me.
But now I know your heart is shackled to that memory.
The more I learn to care for you the more we drift apart.
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

What in the world could this be?
I'm on the verge of an awakening
A new kind of strength for me

I feel a force I've never felt before
I don't want to fight it anymore
Feelings so strong can't be ignored
I burst out - I'm transformed

Rising up, shaking it off
The yesterday dreary
Graceful and strong, No more forlorn
Today's a jubilee
Don't be surprised
This change is my design

I feel a force I've never felt before
I don't want to fight it anymore
Feelings so strong can't be ignored
I burst out - I'm transformed

I feel a force I've never felt before
I can't hold it down I've just got to soar
And laugh in the face that is vulture law
I burst out, I'm transformed

I feel a force I've never felt before
I don't want to fight it anymore
Feelings so strong can't be ignored
I burst out - I'm transformed

I feel a force I've never felt before
I can't hold it down I've just got to soar
And laugh in the face that is vulture law
I burst out - I'm transformed
I burst right out - Into a swan

And I don't stand a chance against the monsters that my mind creates.
I don't want to be here, I just want to be numb
Escape the fucking people that believe in this system.
You know they're watching, counting on your mistakes
Waiting for failure, can you carry the weight?
Once had a future, now I'm watching it die
Damn my reflection in the shadows of night.

Listen closely, hear this whole world crumbling
Slowly breaking patiently dissolving
And disgusted with being spoonfed my death-
I can taste it.
Fuck my soul for collecting dust,
I was down and out in the winter months
When I lost old friends that I used to trust
And left promises out in the rain to rust.
Maybe I'm losing control,
Cough up my lungs with the cynical
The older I get, still can't shake the doubt
Still dwell on the shit that drips out your mouth.

So let it be known,
Let the fucking truth be told.
You'll do your best to establish a life on someone else's time.
Your spirit's only borrowed
And all you know,
You miss the days when you could've changed old stupid ways
And all the stars in your eyes have made it hard
To even want to be alive anymore."

When you can never begin to find the end of your tears
When your heart cries loud and no one seems to hear

Seems she ran aground on manoeuvres
One of our submarines

A hungry heart
To regulate their breathing
One more night
The Winter Boys are freezing in their spam tin
The Baltic moon
Along the northern seaboard
And down below
The Winter Boys are waiting for the storm

Bye-bye, empire; empire, bye-bye
Shallow water--channel and tide

And I can trace my history
Down one generation to my home
In one of our submarines
One of our submarines

Red lights flicker, sonar weak
Air valves hissing open
Half her pressure blown away
Flounder in the ocean
See the Winter Boys
Drinking heavy water from a stone

Bye-bye, empire; empire, bye-bye
Shallow water--channel and tide
Bye-bye empire, empire bye-bye
Tired illusion drown in the night

And I can trace my history
Down one generation to my home

Should have seen the end of summer in your eyes
Should have listened when you said, ""Goodnight""
You really meant goodbye
Baby, ain't it funny, how I never ever learn to fall?
You're really on your knees when you think you're standing tall
But only fools are 'Know it all's' and I played that fool for you

I cried and I cried there were nights that I died for you, baby
I tried and I tried to deny that your love drove me crazy, baby

If the love that I've got for you is gone
If the river I cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song

Baby, I thought you and me would stand the test of time
Like we got away with the perfect crime
But we were just a legend in my mind
I guess that I was blind
Remember those nights dancing at the masquerade?
The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
You and I were the renegades, some things never change

It made me so mad 'cause I wanted it bad for us, baby
And now it's so sad that whatever we had, ain't worth saving

If the love that I got for you is gone
And if the river I've cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song
If the pain that I'm feelin' so strong is the reason that I'm holding on
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song

I cried and I cried there were nights that I died for you, baby
I tried and I tried to deny that your love drove me crazy, baby

If the love that I got for you is gone

Frost in summer, to chill your heart
A drifting memory of autumn decay
A shadowed soul in a fetter of light

An abyssic voice in purile mind... a fallen one
Wandering by the shores, of eternal sin...

The sun no longer shines here
Endless waves roll upon the endless shores
A sullen ship drifts upon the blackest tide
Beneath darkened boughs, no song is heard...
An endless forest where the devil's shadows play
...Here I am King

I know no other world
I know no other...
For here I am King
And a King I shall stay...

But I won't be fooled again
I need some time to figure it out
And put things on the mend

Well I hope that's true for me
Been stabbed in the back so many times
By my troubled history
Just need a reason why can't I just justify
All the pain and suffering
Yell Out in defiance
Your world's not for me
Confused on a path down a one-way street
Blind from what I can't see
I did it once before like some stupid trend
But I won't be fooled again
Blank stares from a million eyes
That are looking back at me
I sit around and ask myself
Just what the fuck they see
Am I all that you ever wanted
Do I fit your policy?
Wont be a victim of your mad disease
Or your uniformity"

The hypocrisy that surrounds my temple
Is assisted by pretenders to the throne

Signify my chosen legacy

A contender to creation

I will ask no forgiveness
For my sins
They are not to forgive

Your style to my style you can't hold a candle to it
Equinox symmetry and the balance is right
Smokin' and drinkin' on a Tuesday night

It's not how you play the game it's how you win it
I cheat and steal and sin and I'm a cynic
For those about to rock we salute you
The dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to

I once was lost but now I'm found
The music washes over and you're one with the sound
Who shall inherit the earth? The meek shall
And yo, I think I'm starting to peak now, Al

And the man upstairs I hope that he cares
If I had a penny for my thoughts I'd be a millionaire
We're just 3 M.C.'s and we're on the go
Shadrach Mesach Abednego

Only 24 hours in a day
Only 12 notes, well a man can play
Music for all and not just one people
And now we're gonna bust with the Putney Swope sequel

More Adidas sneakers than a plumber got pliers
Got more suits than Jacoby &amp; Meyers
If not for my vices and my bugged out desires
My year would be good just like Goodyear's tires

So I'm out pickin' pockets at the Atlantic Antic
And nobody wants to hear you 'cause your rhymes are damn frantic
I mix business with pleasure way too much
You know, wine and women and song and such

I don't get blue I gotta mean red streak
You don't pay the band your friends and that's weak
Get even like Steven like pulling a Rambo
Well Shadrach Mesach Abednego, you know

Steal from the rich and I'm out robbing banks
Give it to the poor and I always give thanks
Because I got more stories than J.D. got Salinger
I hold the title and you are the challenger

I've got money like Charles Dickens
I got the girlies in the Coupe like the Colonel's got the chicken
Always go out dapper like Harry S. Truman
I'm madder than Mad's Alfred E. Neuman

*Never gonna let them say that I don't love you*

Well, my noggin is hoggin' all kinds of thoughts
Adam Yoggin is Yauch and he's rockin' of course
Smoke the holy chalice got my own religion
Rally round the stage and check the funky dope musicians

Like Jerry Lee Swaggert or Jerry Lee Falwell
You love Mario Andretti 'cause he always drives his car well
Vicious circle of reality since the day you were born
And we love the hot butter on what? The popcorn

Sippin' on wine and mackin'
Rockin' on the stage with all the hands clappin'
Ride the wave of fate it don't ride me, homes
*Being very proud to be an M.C.*

And the man upstairs I hope that he cares
If I had a penny for my thoughts I'd be a millionaire
Amps and crossovers under my rear hood
Because the bass is bumpin' from the back of my Fleetwood

They tell us what to do? Hell no!

Es hat dir gut geschmeckt, du weißt jetzt, ich bin gut im Bett
Du hast gecheckt, dass ich es dir besorgen kann

You know playin' blind man's bluff is a little baby's game
You pick up Little Dynamite I'm gonna pick up Little Gun
And together we're gonna go out tonight and make that highway run
You don't have to call me lieutenant Rosie and I don't want to be your son
The only lover I'm ever gonna need's your soft sweet little girl's tongue
And Rosie you're the one

Dynamite's in the belfry playin' with the bats
Little Gun's downtown in front of Woolworth's tryin' out his attitude on all the cats
Papa's on the corner waitin' for the bus
Mama she's home in the window waitin' up for us
She'll be there in that chair when they wrestle her upstairs 'cause you know we ain't gonna come
I ain't here for business baby, I'm only here for fun
And Rosie you're the one

Rosalita jump a little lighter,
Senorita come sit by my fire
I just want to be your lover ain't no liar,
Rosalita you're my stone desire

Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they're gonna be there
Ah Sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool,
Stay out all night, it's gonna feel all right
So Rosie come out tonight, Oh baby come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
Closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So use it Rosie, that's what it's there for

Rosalita jump a little lighter,
Senorita come sit by my fire
I just want to be your lover ain't no liar,
Rosalita you're my stone desire

Now I know your mama she don't like me 'cause I play in a rock and roll band
And I know your daddy he don't dig me but he never did understand
Your papa lowered the boom he locked you in your room
I'm comin' to lend a hand
I'm comin' to liberate you, confiscate you, I want to be your man
Someday we'll look back on this and it will all seem funny
But now you're sad, your mama's mad
And your papa says he knows that I don't...
(...Have any money)
Oh, your papa says he knows...
(...That I don't have any money)
Oh, so your daddy says he knows that I don't have...
(...Any money)
Well, tell him this is last chance
To get his daughter in a fine romance
Because a record company Rosie just gave me a big advance

And my tires were slashed and I almost crashed but the Lord had mercy
And my machine she's a dud out stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey
Well, hold on tight, stay up all night 'cause Rosie I'm comin' on strong
By the time we meet the morning light I will hold you in my arms
I know a pretty little place in Southern California down San Diego way
There's a little cafe where they play guitars all night and all day
You can hear them in the back room strummin'
So hold tight baby 'cause don't you know daddy's comin'

Rosalita jump a little lighter,
Senorita come sit by my fire
I just want to be your lover ain't no liar,
Rosalita you're my stone desire"

Seeds the cloud with dust and blood.

Spin on one and sink your knee,
Right the wrongs of history.

Caminante, son tus huellas el camino why nada más; caminante, no hay camino, se hare camino al andar. Al andar se hare camino why al volver la vista atrás se ve la senda que nunca se ha de volver a pisar. Caminante no hay camino sino estelas en la mar... hare algún tiempo en ese lugar donde hoy los bosques se visten de espinos se oyó la voz de un poeta gritar: «Caminante no hay camino, se hare camino al andar...» golpe a golpe, verso a verso... Murió el poeta lejos del hogar. Le cubre el polvo de un país vecino. Al alejarse le vieron llorar. «Caminante no hay camino, se hare camino al andar...» golpe a golpe, verso a verso... Cuando el jilguero no puede cantar, cuando el poeta es un peregrino, cuando de nada nos sirve rezar. «Caminante no hay camino, se hare camino al andar...» golpe a golpe, verso a verso.

Of kindnesses gone by
Like broken glasses in a drain
Gone down but not well spent

She sold, then stole right back
The vanity, insanity
Her hungry heart forgave

The fading bride's dull beauty glows
Just begging to be seen
Beneath the magic lights that reach
From Barbary to here

You can call him all night but he won't pick up
I danced in the snow and I sang to the stars
'Cause we lost our power just to find our hearts
You gotta lose your power to find your heart

We're alive, alive
And we are fearless
We're alive, alive
And we are fearless
And we are here

I drove all night with a car full of friends
And someone in the back said, ""Where does Canada end?""
My mother took a plane in her nineteenth year
Just someone else's dream, that's why I'm here
Just someone else's dream, that's why we're here

We're alive, alive
And we are fearless
We're alive, alive
And we are fearless
And we are here, we are here

All the things you ever had
Hide and seek, your mom and dad
The car, the park, your broken heart
Your brother locked out after dark

The things we lose, the things we keep
I remember Sauble Beach
Now you're the song and I will sing
'Cause I remember everything

I grew up on the first of July
Just waiting for the light of a firework sky
And the world stood still when your eyes lit up
I will never get old 'cause I feel so young
We will never get old when we feel this young

We're alive, alive
And we are fearless
We're alive, alive
And we are fearless
And we are here

We're alive, alive
And we are fearless
We're alive, alive

Tell me what can I do?...I'm crushin' on you

Oh tell me baby what am I supposed to do?
Can't you see what you've done?
The damage is done, I'm sprung

Maybe I'll call a spychic on the telephone
And she could tell me how to get you all alone
I need a gypsy, to com oaround
Stir up a potion that will cool my body down

I'm burnin' up, you know my body's on fire
Just hold me close, you can feel my deisre
It's only natural for my nature to rise
I fell under your spell, when I looked in your eyes

Oh girl I feel like I'm ready to explode
Because, the time is right, wee should be makin' love all night
So baby let me know, if it's a go
I'm tight as a drum

You turn me on, oh girl I'm sprung

Tried to hide it but I couldn't help it, I had to cry
When my little boy asked me daddy was he your friend
I said no, I didn't even know him.

But he was somebody's someone, a neighbor, a husband
A brother, a father, and a mother's only son
He was an uncle, a cousin, somebody's best friend
And I'm sure at times a shoulder to lean on
He was somebody's someone.

So I sat there in that chair and helped him understand
How this brave young man gave his life for our land
And although he's someone we'll never know
To you and me he is a hero.

He was somebody's someone, a neighbor, a husband
A brother, a father, and a mother's only son
He was an uncle, a cousin, somebody's best friend
And I'm sure at times a shoulder to lean on
He was somebody's someone.

To the world he was a total stranger
Who kept us safe and out of danger
But now he's just a picture on TV
Somebody's memory.

He was somebody's someone, a neighbor, a husband
A brother, a father, and a mother's only son
He was an uncle, a cousin, somebody's best friend
And I'm sure at times a shoulder to lean on

Remember when your mother found us
Remember that you're sorely missed

They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

I'm from the land of the gang bang
Since I was little, ain't a god damn thang changed
It's the same ol' same
Bush run shit like Saddam Hussein
I cock and aim, clinically insane
To deal with this bullshit day to day
If I sell some yay or smoke some hay
You bitches wanna throw me up in Pelican's Bay
Call me an animal up in the system
But who's the animal that built this prison?
Who's the animal that invented lower living?
The projects, thank god for Russell Simmons
Thank god for Sugarhill
I'm putting a different kind of steel up to my grill

Y'all wanna know why it's noise in the hood
Cause there's drugs in the hood, thugs in the hood
Nigga killed a crip and a blood in the hood for real
'Cause when niggas get tribal
It's all about survival, nobody liable
I got caught by five-o
Grandmama came to court with her bible
But when the judge hit the gavel
Now I'm too far from my family to travel
I just came unraveled
Socked the D.A. before I got gaffled
Owned by C.A., state property
Just like the year fifteen fifty three
Looking for me, a one-way ticket out
Don't understand, what's so hard to figure out?

They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

Damn, I can't take the pressure
Pulled the four-four up out the dresser
Grabbed the weight up out the closet
Po-po coming but I'm scared to toss it
Y'all know what happened last time I lost it
Can't tell you niggas what the fuckin' boss did
The game got a nigga exhausted
Gotta go for the big bargain they offered
Twenty years for what?
Breaking these laws that's so corrupt
Taking these halls and fillin' 'em up
Some powder keg shit that's about to erupt
Ay y'all, I'm about to be stuck
Until the year two thousand, what the fuck?
In the hood, don't press your luck
Cause these motherfuckers will set you up, word up

They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs

Everybody loves to lie
Storyteller reconsider did you see him there
Or was it just his picture hanging on the wall
Politician refuse to listen to the truth you hear
Will another dollar help to set him free
Everybody wants to see their face on MTV
Everybody loves to lie
Until we all fall down
And then we'll finally figure it out

Paranoia may destroy the things in life that you love
But by now are gone -- gone gone gone

To be gun flashing, blasting that's why we ain't lasting
All fastened, strapped ready for rivals harassing
Looking over your shoulder ducking cars that are passing
In my rumbo you hear that latin lingo
Guns shoot through at pachucos fuckin' sickos
With four nickels nobody walks around single
Get caught slipping they'll pull your card from a window
It's that simple locals get gaffled by barrio locos
Steal their Spanish grease making them shed a tear like willie bobo
Over dollars, chains and rings things that are worth poco
A coco's out there stealing 'cause they're fiending for perico
A head crack will strike and attack for a sack
Pawn or sell your shit to buy a rock and bring that high back
That's why I strap it's my defense against those
Who are committing defense randomly becoming foes?
Shit is survival of fittest testing who's biggest and realest on the street
Feel this beware of killers, stealers and dealers
Rebel guerillas striking on policemen who give us
Hard times in the city where no love is with us

I've been waiting so very long for you to say it to me

I'd be skating
Skating on thin ice if I don't agree (-e-e-eee)

I know that you're the one for me
But it took me by surprise
And if I say it back to you
I can't look you in the eye
But I don't want to lose you
And I don't want to confuse you
I guess that this my cue to give you my reply

And you killed it
You killed it
You killed it with I love you
And you killed it
You killed it
You killed it with I love you

And you killed it with I love you
What am I supposed to say back to you
And you killed it with I love you, with I love you

I know it's only
Only three little words that I seem to be so scared of
I'm so scared of
So please show me
How to get these words off the tip of my tongue and out of my mind.
I know that you're the one for me but it took me by surprise
But if I say it back to you
I can't look you in the eye

And you killed it
You killed it
You killed it with I love you

Three little words running round in my head
There's no one else that I'd rather be next to
I guess what I'm trying to say is I love you

And you killed it
You killed it
You killed it with I love you

4732,TRAAVGB12903CFAA99.h5,Hank Locklin,Filipino Baby,"When the warship left Manila sailing proudly o'er the sea
Many sailors hearts were filled with sad regret
Looking backward to this Island where they spent such happy hours
Making love to every pretty gal they've met
Well up stopped a little sailor with his bright eyes all aglow
Saying take a look my gal's photograph
Then the sailors gathered round him just to look upon her face
And he said I love my Filipino baby
She's my Filipino baby she's my treasure and my pet
Her teeth are bright and pearly and her hair is black as jet
Her lips are sweet as honey and her heart is true I know
And I love my little Filipino baby

In a little rustic cottage in the Port of Fillippines
Dwells a pretty little maiden all alone
And she's thinking of her true love though he's far off cross the sea
And her heart beats true for him and him alone
Then one day he whispered darling I've come back from Caroline
I've come back to claim the only girl I love
And that night there was a wedding while the ships crew gathered round
And he wed his little Filipino baby
She's my Filipino baby..."

Another boy from another side

Familiar words at the top of the hour

And those terrible words continue to come
Through brass music of government hear those
Guns tattoo a roll on the drums

No one knows what they're fighting for

For the snows they melt the soonest when the winds begin to sing
And the swallow flies without a thought as long as it is spring
But when spring goes and winter blows my love she will be fain
For all her pride to follow me across the stormy main

The snows they melt the soonest when the winds begin to sing
And the bee that flew when summer shone in winter cannot sting
And I've seen a woman's anger melt between the nicht and morn
So it's surely not a harder thing to melt a woman's scorn

So don't you bid me farewell now no farewell I'll receive
But you must lie with me my lass then kiss and take your leave

the goodbye I don't know how to say 
because I will be never able to live without you

If one of these day you would decide to get away from me
I would close every door, so you could never go out
I give you my silence, I give you my nose,
I give you even my bones, but stay here.

You die so I exist.

In case of upheaval, fundamental movement below,

When I get deep, wanna hear my soul sleep,
Not drowning, tumbling around and around in the voices
Like a crowd in my head so loud,
I wonder what it's like to be dead,
I hope it's quiet, noise in my head like a riot,
Any remedy you have for me I'll try it.
Just below my skin I'm screaming...

I'm going deep, so deep that I can't sleep,
The pills ain't cheep booze is deep,
So I leak a fifth of booze and a spliff,
Try to snooze,
But whose dream am I in? This is win or lose,
Put down the drink. Try not to think,
Let it go, fundamental movement below,
And yo, reality is dreaming,

a estudiar desde temprano
No hay quien las pueda separar
Y alguna tarde hay algo más,

We're retreating into the vogue where we're sucking the blood from the necks of guitars.
Beg for the scraps of prose that piled up behind the bar.
Though we try and try and try we get the melody wrong but we remember the words. We're the parasites but we are delicate in the way we bring each other down.
We were oh so close to the start when they finished us.

Aim the mast at the ground, x2
And sail us to the belly of the whale.

What you want is an unexpected approach,
That may delay a suspects awareness of your presence,
Until you have a chance to assist the situation you are confronted.

Approach to danger, don't move;
It's hard to predict what will happen next.
(Oh shit, he has a gun!) drop the gun
You could've prevented a tragedy.

Ren:
You can approach, but the danger-light is blinking,
A self-desctruct button is activated when I'm thinking.
This is a tribulation, the weakened judge,
The prophecy was fulfilled 'cause I never budge.
I took up the tools, crucifixion was the extreme,
They're seeing doubles of me, but it wasn't a dream.
One vision was of life, the other was death,
Then I didn't give a fuck if death took your last breath.
So you burn in my pit that I call hell,
Where you got send because your shit don't sell.
My twenty-twenty was blurry from the smoke,
Of the niggaz that I burned and tormented but I didn't choke.
I started doing 'em, I kept on doing 'em,
Do 'em for shoot 'em up till that nigga Ren was booing 'em.
And my presence to the suckers was of a stranger,
But fuck it, they can approach to the danger.

Eazy:
If you can be seen, you can be hit.
If you can be hit, you can be killed.
(He's on the line! Shoot him!)

Dre:
Fatal approach to danger, just to remain a strangeler,
Outrun, the shot of a gun with a ganger.


Murder in the first degree, but it's worse to be,
A dead motherfucker or a nigga in custody.
With everybody thinking of death I kept working,
To be one of the last niggaz left.
So many people looking for hope, they're broke,
Without checking the fingerprints on the motherfuckers' throat.
A heart of steal can reveil the real nigga in me,
So figuring to see the D-E-A-D
Bodies like a nigga's straight walking in a cemetery,
So it's very necesarry to carry ammunition for niggaz wishing,
But they better take caution, before Dre goes off,
And starts killing motherfuckers,
Just in order to change the anger for the real nigga,
When I approach to danger

Approach the motherfucking danger,
Come back to hell and send me some time... (this is it y'all)

Eazy:
Final approach to danger, death, destruction around every corner,
Another dead body and you wanna keep running.
But even the rain turns black,
All you can do is stay alert to try to say out of the search-light.
No prison, nobody makes bail,
Everybody gotta go but see, it ain't no jail.
Think about death, taking your last breath,
Heart beating like a motherfucker like there ain't no time left.
For so many ways to stay up, I gotta get mine,
Even though they wanna make a crime.
Yo, I'm being real, a better or latter in the beginning,
Because it will release the fucking police.
Fuck 'em, I approach to danger,
'Cause I don't give a fuck if somebody gotta get fucked up.
So you might as well kiss your ass goodbye,
Cause in the long run... (we'll all die)"

This disorder in creation of life
Within this endless reign
Vision of lost words rise

Black god to raise hate in veins of the apocalypse
Holocaust of this testament in perceived idea of doom

The left hand of darkness shall bring this final redemption
Conspiracy in the offerings shall ring in horns of requiem

The principle power of deception in tainting the idol's blood
Held in this testimony for the opening of revelation
Unleash the revenge
Bound in the inverted rites

Raise the great wargate in promise of the fallen ones
Adorned in rank through dark incantations, marching forth
Disfigure in abstract reason
Embrace the blind god
Suspension of this balance will break and fall

Be the sword of evil in dissecting of this praise of mercy
Monumental torture within the halls of the cleansed
Perverse in this exploration of a medium absorbed in fear
This lifeless blasphemy will assume the form of wrath

Desecration
An arousing repulsion to this spirited resistance
This desolate becoming

Supremacy
In attaining this oblivion
This force of hell
Great heavens will burn

Bastard in praise with tainted thought
Creation in death
Bound in nails
Great crown of razors
This truth bathed in lies

Fascination of the compelling terror that lies within dark hearts
Warning of the coming horsemen
These revelations will bring sacrifice

Descending
Chained under the earth
The judgment of rebirth
Arise from flame and blood

Revolt of descent
Rebellion in swarms
Dying forgiveness for unanswered prayers."

Get away from, get away from, get away from you.

os besasteis en silencio
donde no habia luz.

Y me hace gracia tu manera de contarlo
como el que cuenta que ha pensado
que ha decidido, que seguimos siendo amigos
y yo, estoy temblando...

Cracks in the pavement, reveal cravings for success
Why do we try to hide our past
By pulling down houses and build car parks
Windows and mirrors like a two-way glass
This is progress, nothing stands in its path

Yellow bulldozers, the donkey jackets and J.C.B.'s
While hundreds are homeless they're constructing a parking space

Why do they have to knock them down
And leave the site dormant for months on end?
Who has the right to make that choice?
A man whose home has cost forty grand

Allí viví la alegría... distancia
de aquel primer sentimiento
que se ha quedado dormida... distancia
entre la niebla del tiempo.
Primer amor de mi vida... distancia,
que no pasó del intento;
primer poema del alma... distancia,
que se ha quedado en silencio.

¿Dónde estarán los amigos... distancia,
que compartieron mis juegos?
¿quién sabe donde se han ido... distancia,

And never forsake us
Is coming to take us
And take us to our home

He's shouting your name and asking for more

There's a devil crawling along your floor
With a trembling heart,
He's coming through your door
With his straining sex in his jumping paw
There'a a devil crawling along your floor
And he's old and he's stupid and he's hungry and he's sore
And he's blind and he's lame and he's dirty and he's poor
There's a devil crawling along your floor

You might think he's asleep

Nobody around to make you say
Stand strong and you will grow

Ooh Wait till they see your smile

Don't they love to see you down?
Kick you while you're on the ground
Don't let emotions show

People always speculate
Don't let it get in your way
They say things they don't know

But you don't really need 'em much

She's been shaking it since she was sixteen
Skips across the tables acting out her passion play

It wasn't for money, it's only a chance
You take a gamble, got shot for romance

Chains, chains pulling you down
Chain of love that turns your world around
Chains chains pulling you down
Chain of love that turns your world around

Without a warning Jeannie took off one night
Jack got so mean boy, he just had to fight
He died on the floor someone else evens the score
Back on the tables Jeannie's romance had died
That one look of love that told her a lie
And for her there's no waves crashing on seashores

It wasn't for money, it's only a chance

Yeah, I'll find a way to cure the pain
If I said that you're my friend
And our love would never end
How long before I had your trust again?

I opened up the doors when it was cold outside
Hoping that you'd find your own way in
But how can I protect you
Or try not to neglect you
When you won't take the love I have to give?

I bought me an illusion
And I put it on the wall
I let it fill my head with dreams
And I had to have them all

But oh, the taste is never so sweet
As what you'd believe it is
Well, I guess it never is
It's these prejudiced illusions
That pumps the blood to the heart of the biz

You know I never thought that it could take so long
You know I never knew how to be strong
Yeah, I let you shape me
But I feel as though you raped me
'Cause you climbed inside my world and in my songs

Now I've closed the door to keep the cold outside
Seems somehow I've found the will to live
But how can I forget you
Or try not to reject you
When we both know it takes time to forgive, yeah

Sweetness is a virtue
And you lost your virtue long ago
You know I'd like to hurt you
But my conscience always tells me no

You could sell your body on the street
To anyone whom you might meet
Who'd love to try and get inside
And bust your innocence open wide

'Cause my baby's got a locomotive
My baby's gone off the track
My baby's got a locomotive

I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look, I'm not to blame, no

Gonna have some fun with my frustration
Gonna watch the big screen in my head
I'd rather take a detour
'Cause this road ain't getting clearer
Your train of thought has cut me off again

Better tame that boy 'cause he's a wild one
Better tame that boy 'fore he's a man
Sweetheart don't make me laugh
You's getting too big for your pants
And I's think maybe you should cut out while you can

You can use you illusion
Let it take you where it may
We live and learn
And then sometimes it's best to walk away

Me, I'm just here hanging out in my only place to stay
At least for now anyway
I've worked too hard for my illusions
Just to throw them all away

I'm taking time for quiet consolation
In passing by this love that's passed away
I know it's never easy
So why should you believe me
When I've always got so many things to say

Calling off the dogs, a simple choice is made
'Cause playful hearts can sometimes be enraged
You know I tried to wake you
I mean how long could it take you
To open up your eyes and turn the page, hey

Kindness is a treasure
And it's one towards me you've seldom shown
So I'll say it for good measure
To all the ones like you I've known

You know I'd like to shave your head
And all my friends could paint it red
'Cause love to me's a two way street
And all I really want is peace

But my baby's got a locomotive
My baby's gone off the track
My baby's got a locomotive
Gotta peel the bitch off my back

I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look I'm not to blame, no

Affection is a blessing
Can you find it in your sordid heart
I tried to keep this thing together
But the tremor tore my pad apart

Yeah, I know it's hard to face
When all we've worked for's gone to waste
But you're such a stupid woman
And I'm such a stupid man
But love, like time's, got its own plans

'Cause my baby's got a locomotive
My baby's gone off the track
My baby's got a locomotive
Got ta peel the bitch off my back

I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look I'm not to blame

Its easy come easy go y'all know the rule
HCP motherfucker you know I'll cut loose
And if you got it, I'ma have to touch you
Like knockin' on your door and holla trick-or-treat fool
Its halloween motherfucker, don't let this motherfucker sight you
A robbery to a muderery dance clue
So any way that you want it, I got chu
Its one way hallway nigga, so fuck you

Let's plan a robbery, (a robbery) (lets go...)
Let's plan a robbery (a robbery)
Let's plan a robbery, (a robbery) (lets go...)
Let's plan a robbery (a robbery)

(Chorus continues with next part)

You see good with this yay, but I'm better with these guns
I manage dope to collect these funds

You see good with this yay, but I'm better with these guns
I manage dope to collect these funds

(Chorus ends)

I ran up in his spot, with the glock, his jaw dropped
He knew I came for money and the weight I heard he got
I cracked him in the middle of his face with the tome
Tied his ass up and ransacked his home
I had to rep his bitch cause the hoe was stacked
I fucked her from the back, with my gun to her back
I left up out his crib, with dolla and purple hat
But eventually got caught cause ?????????

Don't let me find out that you got that dope
Don't let me find out that you snitchin on folks
Don't let me find out that you tryna get rich
Riddin round' the fuckin' hood 'n' makin' fun of niggaz shit
Don't let me find out, feds tap a nigga phone
Don't let me find out, 'cause if I find out its on
Don't let me find out that niggaz sellin purple drank
'Cause I'ma rob all dem fools, like I robbed 20 banks

Let's plan a robbery, (a robbery) (lets go...)
Let's plan a robbery (a robbery)
Let's plan a robbery, (a robbery) (lets go...)
Let's plan a robbery (a robbery)

You watch your feet for cracks in the pavement

Making home movies for the folks back home
Of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets

They're all uptight, uptight

I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when I'm driving
Take me on board their beautiful ship
Show me the world as I'd love to see it

I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely
I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
They'd shut me away

Repasser, poussière, y'a toujours à faire
Repas solitaire, en point de repère

La maison si nette, qu'elle en est suspecte
Comme tous ces endroits où l'on ne vit pas
Les êtres ont cédé, perdu la bagarre
Les choses ont gagné, c'est leur territoire

That these thoughts are so na've 
When we've all disagreed from the start 

We are the citizens of the planet 
We were born here 
We're gong to die here 
Come what may 
We are entitled by our birth 
To the treasures of the earth 
No one must be denied these 
No one must be denied

Easy dreams at the end of the day"

Casting shivering shadows on the houses through the trees
And the light from a street lamp paints a pattern on my wall
Like the pieces of a puzzle or a child's uneven scrawl

Up a narrow flight of stairs in a narrow little room
As I lie upon my bed in the early evening gloom
Impaled on my wall, my eyes can dimly see
The pattern of my life and the puzzle that is me

From the moment of my birth to the instant of my death
There are patterns I must follow just as I must breathe each breath
Like a rat in a maze, the path before me lies
And the pattern never alters until the rat dies

And the pattern still remains on the wall where darkness fell
And it's fitting that it should for in darkness I must dwell
Like the color of my skin or the day that I grow old
My life is made of patterns that can scarcely be controlled"

Se yö, sylityö
Kestää aamukuuteen

Uupumustaan nukkuu Sonjakin
Viipyy huulillaan tuoksu konjakin
Kun saalista on pikku Maritta vain
Silmäin harittavain, äijäin parittavain

Kestää aina kuuteen

Laukee täyttymykseen
Ja kertakäyttölempi

Eikä sano mitä teen

Hits the wall behind my head and boom
There goes another fine day dream

A real model, a hero of my youth
A man that only sings the truth
Was just sitting down to talk to me

Said, son, the secret of my overnight success
Was hard work and luck for twenty years and nothing less

If you hang around long enough
If you can have a good time when times are tough
Then maybe, just maybe
You get around to figure it out
What you can do and do without
And you recognize the real stuff
If you hang around long enough

Well, a bar talk is politics and work
Women rule and men are jerks
And I say, what else is new

And the waitress is hot and the beer is cold
Feeling young and getting old
But I don't know what I'd rather do

So, ill with the flow I need a M.D.
Somebody call a doctor
I make 'em all sick when I hop out the phantom of the opera
Oppo-site to what I call a failure
I am the reasons y'all can't look in the mirrors

Could we live side by side, could we be friends?
We're not all the same, I know this is true.
But I am just me, and you are just you.
 
We tell our own lives, we live all thus.
The old dreams don't die, the memories last.
But to die for a dream, is such a tragic romance.
Prejudice and pride, a dangerous dance.
 
Oh hear the pipes playing, take up your stance.
And our children will pay for our dangerous dance.
 
And the best part of reason, gets lost in time.
Not just off old books, it's still in our eyes.
And there's beauty in old books, when there's truth on the page.
And when we're all gone, what will the books say?
 
Oh hear the pipes playing, take up your stance.
And our children will pay for our dangerous dance.

In Paris and Geneve
In Frankfurt and Berlin
In London, Rome and Lisbon
A crisis will begin
Do you feel anticipation?
Do you feel you're being used?
It's the resurrection showdown
It's the winners turn to lose

Let's go all the way
There's a target to destroy
Let's go all the way
There's an army to deploy
Let's go all the way
You're free to make a choice
Are you ready?
Let's say it now with just one voice

Change, Change, Change
I'm the resurrection man
Let's go all the way
Reach out and touch my hand
Let's go all the way
You know somebody's got to pay
Get ready
Get ready for the judgement day


This is a song of independence
You think you've seen it all before
I know you run and try and hide it
And sometimes you might deny it
But you've got a taste for more
(Isn't that worth fighting for ?)

Let's go all the way
Can't you see that we've had enough
Let's go all the way
Before the going gets too rough
Let's go all the way
You're free to use your voice
Are you ready?
Win or lose you have a choice

Come someone make my heavy heart light
Come undone bring me back to life

Journey homeward bound
A sound of a dolphin calling
Tearing off the mask of man
The tower my sole guide

This is who I am

Farewell now time to fly
Out of sight, out of time, away from all lies

""Murder? yeah, murder one son, for the death of jane"" (repeat 4x)

Aiyyo they came to my jail cell, and let me go on technicalities
The girl that got merked, it wasn't Jane, it was fuckin' Valerie
The prostitute from downtown, we checked the dental records
Found her butt naked, and on the side EPMDd record
Two hours later on greyhound, on my way now
Peeped the shorty up front, starin' wants to play now
Set gets laid out, she black, draws the gat
Screamin 'lay flat' then bust a cap as she walk back
Remain cool, I want the money quality jewels
And anybody breakin these rules they get two's
This is a jack, pass the money back, no eye contact
Relax, and keep quiet and pass the bag back
To my accomplice, havin' no nonsense
That's when another girl pushed up, white girl on some calm shit
Thinkin' quick that's when the hammer went click
An off-duty p.o., licked off and touched first bitch,
She fell, hit the floor, she was leakin
My partner cock back, blast, one woman started screamin
Who's next? who wanna flex? Cop in the seat wet
Licked another shot off, hit the driver then the bus tipped
Shit's thick, that's when she grabbed me took me hostage
Told me 'snatch the bags and don't fuck with my props kid'
Pistol still smokin', she kicked the fuckin' door open
Bus on it's side wheels spinnin, with the engine smokin'
Runnin' on the shoulders, she put the gat in the holster
Played it cool, and never lost my composure
As screamin soldier got closer,
I followed her to the drop point, she took the leads off a range rover
And passed me the keys, proceeded to roll trees
Shorty gained her silence, guess what was in the CD
And as I did the knowledge the jeep raised from the hydraulic
I'm thinkin', ""could this be jane as my co-pilot?""
Time to activate, jane on the license plate
Pushin ninety-five with no headlights, on the interstate

""Murder? Yeah, murder one son for the death of jane"" (repeat 8x)"

Just a little too long a while
You say you're gonna get your act together
Gonna take it out on the road
But if I don't get outta here pretty soon
My head's going to explode

Sure I like country music
I like mandolins
But right now I need a telecaster
Through a vibro-lux turned up to ten

Lets go to Memphis in the meantime baby
Memphis in the meantime girl

I need a little shot of that rhythm baby
Mixed up with these country blues
I wanna trade in these ol country boots
For some fine Italian shoes

Forget the mousse and the hairspray sugar
We don't need none of that
Just a little dab'll do ya girl
Underneath a pork pie hat

Until hell freezes over
Maybe you can wait that long
But I don't think Ronnie Milsap's gonna ever
Record this song

Lets go to Memphis in the meantime baby

Maybe there's nothin' happenin' there
Maybe there's somethin' in the air
Before our upper lips get stiff
Maybe we need us a big ol whiff

If we could just get off-a that beat little girl
Maybe we could find the groove
At least we can get a decent meal
Down at the Rendez-vous

'Cause one more heartfelt steel guitar chord
Girl, it's gonna do me in
I need to hear some trumpet and saxophone
You know sound as sweet as sin

And after we get good and greasy
Baby we can come back home
Put the cowhorns back on the cadillac
And change the message on the cord-a-phone

Working steady in a good time band
Pickin' every single little lick I could
Just to please the man
Harlan sang the lead for half
And we split up the rest
Hangin' on through the heavy times
And hopin' for the best

And I can't recall the names of all
Them places that we played in
All them squirrely party girls
And pills we used to pop
Hardly ever sleepin' in
Those cheap motels we stayed in
Hopin' we could take it till we'd make it to the top

And them nights, get a little bit brighter
And them bars just a little bit better
And the sweet, just a little bit sweeter
But them blues, well it's still the same old song

Now we're stars and shining on
Them prime time TV shows
Every stranger knows our name
And every little where we go
Findin' out the bottom ain't so different
&gt;From the top
Just a few more friends that you'll be losin'
When you drop

And I've left some of my soul on
Every sweaty sheet that I could sleep on
Gettin' just as close to any body as I could
I don't regret a single bed I've laid my body down on
Ever since the first I had
The worst I had was good
And them nights, get a little bit brighter
And them bars just a little bit better
And the sweet, just a little bit sweeter
But them blues, well it's still the same old song"

Though the world may whisper and blow in your face 
And tangle the hair on your head

On a hot desert night we can drive down the road 
And the stars will spell out your name
On a hot desert night with the windows down wide
The sirens will sing me their song

And the ghosts of the sailors who died on the rocks 
Feel not a twitch of regret
Though the wind may tangle the hair on your head
You sing like a siren to me

On a hot desert night, the caravan stops 
At the oasis next to your heart
The soundtrack is played by some aged British queen

Though the symphony strings shifts with the sand

To God up in heaven you'll get it I hope

She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way 
And when she stepped out never looked either way

I should really hear you sing again
And I should really watch you dance
Because it's hard to think I'll never get another chance
To hold you
To hold you

But chilly, Mr. Dilly, too much rush to talk to Billy
All the tizzy, fizzy idiot things must get done
In a second, just hang on, all in good time, won't be long
Until later

I should've stop to think, I should've made the time
I could've had that drink, I could've talked a while
I would've done it right, I would've moved us on
But I didn't, now it's all too late
It's over and you're gone

I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you so much

How many times can I talk this way

Keep on aching the same heartbreak

Always to be prepared to die
Blood on a knife edge
Flag of the sea lord flying high

She ties the noods and pulls it tight

Treacherous island
Somewhere to hide on no man's land

With dog eyes and a hanging tongue
It goes way bad
I never like that sad look
From someone who wants to be loved by you

I'm very good with plants
When my friends are away
They let me keep the soil moist
On the seventh day I rest
For a minute or two
Then back on my feet to call for you

You've got cucumbers on your eyes
Too much time spent on nothing
Waiting for a moment to arise
The face in the ceiling
And arms too long
I'm waiting for him to catch me

Certain factions have to be forbidden or destroyed
Fire has to be sent to the poisoned forest
With the root of fresh trees planted elsewhere

Only then will you obtain a wilderness
That cannot be penetrated, petrified family tree

See what started as a family forest
Got cut to a family tree with the limbs
And the leaves looking' at the world for answers
The world points to the sun and the sun says

The answers in me, so I search through the darkness
Can't find the key so we locked in the land of the lost
Lord, please tomorrow ain't promised to you nor me
So now we choose the roots, so we can plant new trees

Many minds always meet with pens and sheets
Close my eyes, think what next on my rhymes
See this face in ink, I'm havin' visions of wisdom
Dreamin' 'bout my own ending

Am I seein' death as freedom and livin' as prison
My son didn't have a daddy to shape him so
God bless him with a daddy to save him
Yeah I raise him and pay some attention

He talked and he listened to reach him and teach him
Before I'm gone from existence
Teach him 'bout the foes, the hos and all opponents
Those that always talk 'bout love but never showed it

Those who had the chances to stand and always blowed it
Those that set you up by the hour to steal your moment
Pac the word is you ain't there so fuck the rumor
I'll get a pound of that shit from Bermuda

And meet you in Cuba
Fucked up on Larusa no doubt, I know the locale
If they gotta born you, I'm gonna mourne you till I join you

So now we choose the roots, so we can plant new trees

Uh and now I know I got some family
Who missed me from the heart, forever we're apart
Just because I'm nothin' and you abuse me and use me
Now you wanna try to come bruise me

And even though maybe were in there
Farther than it once was I know family don't always
Mean that they blood 'cause some people just
Don't give a nigga what some people tried to use my name

So all the fat we had to cut and I'm still
Walking with my six amp strut
Urban eyes see through camouflage
And now I know who's butt

So when I sent you tried to play me
All of a sudden now I'm shady
Maybe deep down in my heart
Never trust you from the start

Never hoped you'd be my homie, don't come 'round my way
And if we never speak again, it's got to be that way
This millennium, we'll be spankin' your heiny
Remind thee naughty invented family of the 90's

Lord, please tomorrow ain't promised to you nor me
So now we choose the roots, so we can plant new trees

Life doesn't end when the sweat dries
A time when a nickel cost a dollar
When you rise your chest dies
My dynasty many fear it 'cause I'm near it

Ancient Egyptian scriptures fitted in through hyroglyphics
Motherfuckers try to touch my mental state
Niggas smile up in your face and then they infiltrate
So it seems nowadays that the only plan

To get my people help my people get a load of land
And I'm'ma see it if I have to kill some shit
To make my family tree a motherfucking wilderness
See a black man standin' on the promised land

Since they broke every promise I devised a plan this
Black this and black that crap is gettin' touchy
Any black hat that cross my path, I call him lucky
Those who turn. they back with they fears

And try to before they can see us
They gonna need us sweet Jesus

See what started as a family forest
Got cut to a family tree with the limbs
And the leaves looking' at the world for answers
The world points to the sun and the sun says

[Dub] Yo P tell 'em whassup man

(Verse One: Parrish Smith)

We was coolin in my car one day you see
Clockin a double nickel on the L-I E
When it dawned on us that it was, ten o'clock
Turned on the tunes to hear the DJ's rock
The hands got to clappin, the fingers got to snappin
E and I was coolin, with his man's, he was snappin
In and out of fantasies on how large we can get
Coolin in rocks and Benzes with the ground effect kits
I wanted black, E was on the two-tone
Stupid boomin system with the hands-free phone
The dream gets better and I would like to go on
But I was brought back to reality by a toot of a horn
Smoke everywhere, oh just what we needed
On the way to shop our demo and the car overheated
Feelin' real low, low enough to die
Holdin' up traffic, on the FDR drive
We had to play ourselves, in the fresh dipped gear
E Double had to push while MD steered
There went our dreams, to cruise in golden limos
And all we kept sayin' was please listen to my demo

Please listen to my demo [x3]
Please-please-please-ple-please listen to my demo

(Verse Two: Erick Sermon)

In the year eighty-seven when we first took off
When I jumped to P-6-8 and broke North
Walkin' the big city streets of Manhattan
Buildings, whole nine yards, so enchantin
Thinkin' if we got a chance, we could rock it
Funky fresh demo tape in my pocket
We was walkin', and got dissed twice today
Then we stopped at 1974 Broadway
We walked in with grins on our chins
And P had juice from Mr. Virgo Simms
He played the tape and we started to laugh
Played ?if it was sock? and they swoop and backstab
People start to smile inside we buckwhylin
Sayin' this all started back from freestylin
They liked it, and they were very kind
But me and P was like, ""Yo E, where do we sign?""
Went in the backroom, things was luvy duvy
Met Ron Resnick, and his partner Juggy
Things was cool, as I remembered
We signed the dotted line, now we Fresh Record members
Had dreams, of fancy cars and limos
And I wanted was somebody, to listen to my demo

Smokin' and drinkin' on a Tuesday night

It's not how you play the game it's how you win it
I cheat and steal and sin and I'm a cynic

Got more suits than Jacoby &amp; Meyers
If not for my vices and my bugged out desires
My year would be good just like Goodyear's tires

And nobody wants to hear you 'cause your rhymes are damn frantic

I've got money like Charles Dickens
I got the girlies in the Coupe like the Colonel's got the chicken
Always go out dapper like Harry S. Truman
I'm madder than Mad's Alfred E. Neuman

Well, my noggin is hoggin' all kinds of thoughts
Adam Yoggin is Yauch and he's rockin' of course
Smoke the holy chalice got my own religion
Rally round the stage and check the funky dope musicians

Like Jerry Lee Swaggert or Jerry Lee Falwell
You love Mario Andretti 'cause he always drives his car well
Vicious circle of reality since the day you were born
And we love the hot butter on what? The popcorn

Sippin' on wine and mackin'
Rockin' on the stage with all the hands clappin'
Ride the wave of fate it don't ride me, homes
*Being very proud to be an M.C.*

And the man upstairs I hope that he cares
If I had a penny for my thoughts I'd be a millionaire

Because the bass is bumpin' from the back of my Fleetwood

Without a sound but our tears rolling down.
But our tears rolling down.

Oh, to understand myself,
Why I feel the way I do,
I can't depend upon my feelings,
They could be anything but true,
Could be I stayed up too late last night,
Could be the morning news,
Could be that I'm not perfect yet,
I got a long way to go, I must admit.

So, somebody get that light and hand me my glasses,
Shake the children from their beds,
Let the Mrs. put on her housecoat,
And a prayer for mercy said,
With all of this welling up inside,
We're headed to the edge of town,
And we're walking the distance
Without a sound but our tears rolling down.
But our tears rolling down.
Oh, our tears rolling down."

Didn't I keep your kids when
You were out smokin' and drinkin'?
Why did I treat you like my king
When you were out doing your own thing?

And I want nothing to do with you
Tell you what I think about me
You think that I'm crazy, you think that I am dumb and naive

Let me break it down let me show you how I'ma put you out
Watch me show and prove, watch me make my moves and get rid of you

You can pack your things, you can take this ring
It don't mean a thing
To the front door, 'cause I can't take no more, I can't take no more

Didn't I show you this good love?
Didn't I do it just because?
Tell me why you went and did me wrong
I heard you sayin' you love her on the phone
Wasn't I down for you and
Even when you put me through it?
Why didn't I listen to my girlfriends
When they said you were not worth it?

Since you went and broke the rules
This is what I got for you
Take your jacket and your shoes
You'll never play me for a fool

Two and three to dance at twilight
Four who give me more and more

Wrap them deep inside your heart
Keep them safe forever

J'ai mis mon adolescence à comprendre combien j't'aimais
Le jour où j'tai roulé ma première galoche
Tu m'as tapé dans l'œil avant qu'j't'aie dans la poche

Depuis ma vie s'résume à une course-poursuite
Chaque fois qu'je tente de t'effleurer dis-moi, pourquoi tu prends la fuite ?
Avec toi, ça va, ça vient
Sans toi j'suis un vaurien
En avoir pour son toi j'aimerais tant
D'ailleurs le temps c'est du toi
Du chagrin j'l'ai gros sur la patate
J'croque de toi sauf quand tu craques
J'ai les bourses qui s'rétractent
Ta courbe croissante m'enchante
Mais ta chute de reins me donne des vertiges et des crampes

T'es la personne la plus ouverte, tu connais pas d'frontières
Tu parles toutes les langues et sait briser les barrières
Snob, la pauvreté te fait horreur
Je t offrirai tous les parfums, toi qui n'as pas d'odeur

Tu n'fais pas l'bonheur
Procure du plaisir
Et plus j'te désire et plus tu m'fais courir
J'te tire mon chapeau et tu m'en fais baver des ronds d'pièces
Je t'aime autant qu'j'te déteste

Quand apprendras-tu à te poser ?

Et tu m'as snobé pour aller danser avec un notable
Pendant qu'j'me faisais biaiser
D'autres avait déjà appris à savoir léser
Au début j'étais rongé par la jalousie
Et puis j'ai bien vite compris qu'tu n'ferai jamais le bonheur d'autrui
Toutes ces formes font rêver mais dans l'fond y a rien
Impalpable, liquide, tu fonds dans leur main
À peine ils tombent, tu lorgnes déjà sur les voisins
Tu les rends possessifs, jaloux, radins et mesquins

T'es partie à la conquête do monde entier
Et l'monde entier a succombé à tes charmes de papier
Aujourd'hui le monde entier est à tes pieds

Just a cry would break it in
And I, I think I heard You
Wish for a friend who is not sleeping
Somebody who would wait in the garden
Somebody how I wish it could be me

I know You know that I am here
'Cause every night I strain my ear 'cause I
I am in waiting
I want to hear You call my name
I want to be the one You can lean on
All of my kingdom just to have the strength

To be the one who brings You water
When Your throat is dry
And who will wipe Your brow when
The salt stings Your eye
I know the wall between us
Is just paper thin
Why can't I, why can't I
Why can't I just cave it in

So porous these walls may be
But I'm still clawing at the seams"

My God he was wealthy, owned half of the county, but he'd never see 60 again. After 10 years of Heaven and long nights of love his ole heart couldn't keep up the pace. But friends you can bet that he had no regrets. Ol' Frank ran one Hell of a race.

She cried all the way to the chapel, like she really cared for Ol' Frank. She cried all the way to the grave where he lay. Then she smiled all the way to the bank.

He had bought her big diamonds and long limousines as she taught him what happiness meant. Lord he spent a fortune on his prized possession. And to him she was worth every cent. Now Ol' Frank is gone and the whole town's still talkin'. They think what she did is a disgrace. There are many who think that she killed poor Ol' Frank but he died with a smile on his face.

Sé que desde ayer me he vuelto a creer 
Que en un papel, que en un rincón 
O una pared 
Puedo encontrar el corazón de una mujer 
Que me busca, me desea, que se muere 
Por querer. 

Qué importan los necios que no sienten, 
Qué importa, qué cuenta la risa de esa

Sé quién eres.

As they all watched in anticipation
The crowd must have longed for
Their own rendezvous

Through the turbulent times
Somehow they survive it
They will walk and not faint, this it true
Through the currents of life
Even though it throws them from side to side

So, I'm waiting on You through the weather
We'll take a trip where the eagles dare
And we're gonna go through it together
'Cause I've got Your promise
You'll carry me there

It's mostly tha voice, that makes you buck
A lot of rappers got flavor, and some got skills
But if your voice ain't dope then you need to (chill... chill...)

Up steps one, and he gets done
Then up steps another, he gets smothered
That's word to mother, or should I say moms
I drop bombs, scorchin niggaz like napalm
Sucka, boy, get off my shit
Get off my dick so what I make butter hits
You better change your behavior, battling Gangstarr
No religion could save ya
My religion is rap, R-A-P
R-E-A-L-I-T-Y, G
'Cause when I rock street kids rejoice
I got mad rhymes, still

So when you think you know the whole you don't even know the half
You're not a threat to myself, and neither to my staff
Not the type to really dance too much, although I used to
Rather bust a fresh line, and get loose to
The blunted ill types of beats Premier makes
Makes your girl's rear shake, let me set it straight

Some rappers use hooks to this shit
But if you took that shit out
And you took all the music out
What would remain? The voice no doubt
Bless my soul I control
When in pimp mode
My bank roll expands
I invest in my man
I plan, to keep rap real
So if your shit ain't fat then kneel
You squeal, feeling pain from my oral flex
What about oral sex, which chick's next
To open wide and get a chunk from a real brother
Yeah, some real funk from a real brother
They get sprung and most of them don't recover
But I don't diss 'em I just talk to em
Cause the sound, of my voice, it does a lot to em
So you and, the niggaz right there
Be aware, like SWV, I'm right here
Waitin to correct your ass
And if you don't follow now I'll disrespect your ass
More Vicious than Sid, do a crime with no bid
I tell a bitch that I didn't when you know that I did
Take a trip to a land a-far
Then come back, and people still know Gangstarr
See I'm the ladies choice
'Cause I got crazy styles, still

Outro: Guru, Shug

Oh shit Shug, whattup
(Whassup money?)
Just loungin, about to go do this shit in the studio
(Oh yeah, you just let me get on that shit
You always said I could get on, you need to let me get on that)
Word?
(For real man)
Yo man
(Don't front on that shit)
I'm sayin' yo, if I let you get busy, youknowhatI'msayin

Protect yourself just keep quiet

Leave you alone.
'Cause the weak will
Seek the weaker till they've broken them.
Could you get it back again?
Would it be the same?
Fulfillment to their lack of strength at your expense,
Left you with no defense;
They tore it down.

And I have felt the same as you,
I've felt the same as you,
I've felt the same.

Locked inside
The only place
Where you feel sheltered,
Where you feel safe.
You lost yourself
In your search to find
Something else to hide behind.

The fearful always preyed upon your confidence.
Did they see the consequence,
When they pushed you around?
The arrogant build kingdoms made of the different ones,
Breaking them till they've become just another crown.

Refuse to feel anything at all,
Refuse to slip,
Refuse to fall.
Can't be weak,
Can't stand still,
You watch your back 'cause no one will.
You don't know why they had to go this far,
Traded your worth for these scars,
For your only company.
And don't believe the lies
That they have told to you. Not one word was true

Who do you think you are
Sharp words from soft red lips
Scratch me with your fingertips

I've learned my lesson and I learned it will
To get to heaven got to go through hell
Here I stand with my soul to sell
To you, yeah

Play with fire you'll end up burned
You think by now I should have learned
I said if you wanna someone else
Then you can go yourself

I tried so hard but I can't say no
I can't hold back I can't let go
A self destructive one man show
Oh

You know I want you, you know I need you
I'd getdown on my knees and pray
You know I want to do what you do
I hang on every word you say

Just give me one chance to do a new dance
I swear I'll try and change my ways
And then I do it all over again
Do it all over again

Been down this road before
Shouldn't do this any more
A voice inside my head says STOP

I search for pleasure but I just found pain
I can't get off this runaway train
So laugh at me while I cry in vain
Oh

You know I love you, you know I want you
Can you give me one more try
I didn't want to, I didn't mean to
I didn't need to make you cry

And I had to, you what I'd do
I'd take a trip right back in time and then
I'd do it all over again
I'd do it all over again"

Awake, angels of lunacy,
Arise, avatars of chaos,
Incinerate yourselves,
In the blaze of Babylon,
Hierophants of the Hurricane,
We invoke the Eidolon.

Unleash the storm...

We renounce the sin,
Of mortal fallacy,
Bestow upon us,
Our stellar legacy.

Peel the benighted shells,
From our radiant cores,
We obey the laws,
Of finitude no more.

Ascend...
In Akasha to Procreate.
Strip the flesh from your soul,
Extend...
Open the Silver Gate...
Melt yourself beyond all control.

Give birth to the vision,
Let enter the voice,
And dare not falter,
Lest the demons eat you.
Confide in your Nuit,
Never your senses.

Nine apparitions,
The nails of Yod,
Drip from the moon
As unhallowed blood,
Anubis' terror to feed you,
As the night condenses.

Ascend...
In Akasha to Procreate.
Strip the flesh from your soul,
Extend...
Open the Silver Gate...
Melt yourself beyond all control.

In poisoned aberration,
Tarnished minion abide,
Convocating execrations,
To drown and smother, to divide.

Recline, Rejoice,
Discard the body,
And savour this, your threnody,
Divine by lust alone,
And second skin,
As the eyes turn to stone,
Let the heave begin!

Azazel!
Shemhazai!
Rejoin your kin in faith and fate!

Heed not the warnings,
We invoke the manyfold
Ny-Ar-Rut-Hotep
For we know,
There is no peace at the gate,
There is no peace at the gate...

Ascend,
In Akasha to procreate,
Strip the flesh from your soul,
Extend, open the Silver Gate,
Melt yourself beyond all control,
In Akasha to procreate,
Disembodied, unfettered souls,
Open the Silver Gate,
We embrace the stars
With twin black holes"

And I unplugged the phone

Where you lay your pretty head
I'm gonna rub your tired shoulders
Bring your dinner to your bed

*Phone dialling*
(Hello?)
Hello, it's '91. Buckle up, guard your grill! Hee hee
(Har what the fuck?)
Has this ever happened to you?
Can you name this tune?
These victims knew how to guard they grill, this would've never happened!

Verse 1: Treach

I put two and two together and I came up with four
You are forever, forgot, forbid, shouldn't have to say much more
I been through more crews than a flute, yeah I'll show ya
This is so damned scrap I betcha bro don't know ya
You tried to get cool and say peace, save that peace for a jigsaw
Stay back and watch a real MC get raw
I never know, never know when another will come to diss this
But if and whenever they come I'm runnin' this merry fist miss
I shooker the crook and shaker the fake to get like a quick stick
It's just another one dud and is dismissed
Kitty guard your grill, well be for real, you ain't built
I'm silly-ho smackin MC's on a ninety degree tilt
The reason that it's tilted 'cause you're guilty, too hard to guard
It's not you're tryin' too gay, you're tryin' too hard
How hard can your guard be, I say wuz up?
Guard your grill, knuckle up, put 'em up, yup!

Guard your grill, knuckle up
I ain't the type to give up
Guard your grill, knuckle up
I smoke first, so what's up
Guard your grill, knuckle up
Put 'em up, you ain't tough
Guard your grill, knuckle up!

Verse 2: Treach

I give 'em much business, an Aspirin
Damn, I love a glass chin
What are ya askin for mercy, I'm laughin'
Huh, you know the game, you know the name and you know the rep
You know the Kay, you know the Vin and you know the Treach
There's no sleepin', no nottin, no rest and hey
No snoozin, no dozin, no f'in way
Heapin things up like a Coke cup
Wind me up but y'all I gets the low wits tha rough stuff
And after enough to cut ya off a piece, still have nuff
Then go around to them and him because ??? ???
I I got posse full a fighters all fly like a chopper
Use to couldn't take 'em out 'cause they was rowdy hip-hoppers
There's so much gold for roast, the ??? don't knock us
My nuts are my only homies that can hang proper
At school I had a lot, I filled with VCR's and Vodka
I had two girls, one a runner, one a trotter
Back then I wore briefs, tella starter, gettin' hotter
Then I grew yeah long so I had to switch to boxers
How hard can your guard be, I say what's up?
Guard your grill, knuckle up, put 'em up, duck

Verse 3: Treach

I don't lay, I lie, who knows like Pinnochio
Never been to Tokyo or *?Keeper's Day Bolochio?*
Guard your grill, here's a feel, I rush hard
I got the fliest ride out here, the '91 bus card
So callin me for a ride ain't the answer
Huh, you want a lift ya better pick up a transfer
Sayin' we will go for one cut, now we're dead
Oh yaeh, that's bout as funny as Barbara Bush in a bobsled
Now how wrong can you be to think we play
Even a broken clock is right at least twice a day
So now ya feelin' real low, ya no flow-crow
You slow hobo, stiffer than Robo
Oh, here's another side of bein real quick
You might speak it fulla cracks, but you still ain't shhh...
So don't try at those same style battle cry
I rock the U-train, the routes that I battle by
I listen to sister shit, it till they quite slow
No matter that white rap, shoot a pharoah with a psycho
Put down ya handgun, up which'cha hands son
Look cops they come, I ain't the damned one
I was only three steps from a peace prize
Pieces laid, piece of his eyes and his left thigh
Knuckle up, put 'em up, yeah guard your grill
And that's comin' from Illtown, down the hill

(Vin Rock) This goes out to the 118th Street Posse
My man J Scratch in the house, y'knowhutI'msayin?
And oh yaeh, pss pss pss pss

I gotta say what's up to my man Pop Dezzy Dezza
(T) What's up to Clark Kent and my man Face!
(KG) This goes out to my man Fitz and the whole Down The Hill

And there's nothing that he got to say that's even worth discussing
Listen to me, it's better to be
Lying dead with honor, soldier, than to never be free

In the battle of the son of the fags
Every other country burning the flag
Don't let history repeat itself
That's how the devil plan to keep his wealth and feed himself
I'm the New York power hitter
Hit the devil in the fucking shitter
Take his manhood and all his glitter
Got guns ready to bust

And seaward they shall flow

With their precious skulls
See the tide come in

Beneath a crimson sky... a seasons birth

We'll drown the newborn like unwanted dogs
And condemn them to their desperate gods
We'll take a needle, to the arm of the world
For it is our season

We'll burn the temples, of the righteous
Rend them as ashes, to the four winds

I could be half the man I used to

Very clever with maracas
Making their fortunes
Selling second-hand tobaccos
Juan dances at Chico's

He empties the ashtrays
And pockets all that he's collected

Pienso que fue un error  haber fingido
Y no me voy a echar  atrás     nunca mas

Deshacerme dentro  y saber si eres tu

Painted lies on walls of hope and
Wasted days for us to grieve

Stay right here

And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground

Oh, when you see it, then you'll understand

All those signs, I knew what they meant
Some things you can't invent
Some get made and some get sent, ooh

Que hable de ti, que hable de mí.
Serán versos en el aire que puedas respirar,
Que te empapen el alma, que te empapen de amor;
Serán letras con verdad unidas en mi corazón
Para decirte que te amo, que te quiero,
Que te sueño, que te necesito.

Cómo puedo explicar lo que el alma intenta decir,
Trato de entender que amar puede ser así.
Evitaré mientras pueda martirizar mi existir,
Dejaré al azar la suerte de sentirte aquí.
Recitaré mi poesía de amor sólo con mis besos;
En ellos te diré que te amo, que te quiero,
Que te sueño, que te necesito"

Did you wash them in the waters of a grave?

Silence in sovereign fleet the hand that dare seize the fire.
Struggle to sound above the piercing,

Stalking in this fearful symmetry the trail back,

Slowly they will tarnish and break.
The tiger utters not his own name.
And in triumph, and in glory,
Our earth is blackened. 
In solace do we sing.

There's no easy way to be free
No easy way to be free

It's a hard, hard world

I left my doctor's prescription bungalow behind me
I left the door ajar
I left my vacuum flask
Full of hot tea and sugar
Left the keys right in my car

Slip kid, slip kid, second generation
Only half way up the tree
Slip kid, slip kid, I'm a relation
I'm a soldier at sixty-three
No easy way to be free

Slip kid, slip kid

Keep away old man, you won't fool me
You and your history won't rule me
You might have been a fighter, but admit you failed
I'm not affected by your blackmail
You won't blackmail me

I've got my clipboard, text books
Lead me to the station
Yeah, I'm off to the civil war
I've got my kit bag, my heavy boots
I'm runnin' in the rain
Gonna run till my feet are raw

Slip kid, slip kid, slip out of trouble
Slip over here and set me free
Slip kid, slip kid, second generation
You're slidin' down the hill like me
No easy way to be free
No easy way to be free
No easy way to be free"

Tonight...
The stars are aligned and the planets colliding
And the plan is arriving and she's out there smiling
The fear is upon us, the skies tried to warn us
Your parents are goners, no children to mourn
It's driving me crazy, this war is my lady
These bombs are our babies and God is amazing
The tick of the timer, the slip of your rival
The pimps and the rise of your pulse, where you'll find her
Hey hey 

(Chorus - Matthew Santos)
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight

(Verse One - Lupe Fiasco)
Disease, the virus is spreadin' in all directions
No safe zone, no cure and no protection
No symptoms to find, the signs of an infection
No vaccines, remedies and no corrections
Quarantine your dreams and sever all connections
Don't let 'em in not a friend, not a reflection
Everybody's got it and wants you to have it next and
Don't accept 'em if you want to stay as an exception
No pill can heal the ill of this
Sickness some are still in doubt of its existence
Some call it forgiveness and some call it the vengeance
Some say it's an exit, some say it's an entrance
The poor say the rich have the cure
The rich say the poor are the source
Revolutionaries say it's psychological war 
Invented by the press just to have something to report
Some say the first case came from a maternity ward
Some say a morgue, some say the skies, some say the floors
""Whores,"" say the nuns, ""nuns,"" say the whores
And everybody is sure
The scientists say, ""it only infects the mind""
The little boy said, ""it only infects the girls""
The preacher man said, ""it's gonna kill off the soul""
A bum said, ""it's gonna kill the whole wide world""

(Chorus - Matthew Santos)
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her finger
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her finger
Streets are on fire tonight

(Verse Two - Lupe Fiasco)
Believe! Some say the neon signs by the loud speakers repeatin' that everything is fine
A subtle silence to demolish the trouble conscience of accomplished with no knowledge and every freedom denied
Every dream is designed and broadcasted from the masses to the masses from the antennaes on top of the shrines
Was fine and received and planted during the panic and surely it reports back everything in your mind
Everything is lyin', everything is dyin'
Everying is a rule, everything is a crime
Everything was here then everything rewind
New weather burned the feathers off everything flyin'
(And she likes it, and she loves it)
The sadness, the madness, the bad shit, the lavish, the fastest, the clashes
The ashes to ashes, everything intertwined
My femme fatale, my darlin' fallen angel
Once caught her changin' the batteries in her halo
Receipt for wings and everything that she paid for
And the address to the factory where they made those
The scientist said, ""she's already inside my mind""
The little boy said, ""what happened to all the girls?""
The preacher man said, ""she's gonna kill off the soul""
The dope boy said, ""it's the whole wide world""

(Chorus - Matthew Santos)
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight"

She said ""Son, you feel kinda warm""
And she looked into her crystal ball
Said ""You're in love"" 

Said it could not be so
Not with all the girls I know
She said when the next one arrives
Looking into her eyes 

I left there in a hurry
Looking forward to my big surprise
The next day I discovered
That the fortune teller told me a lie 

I hurried back down to that woman
As mad as I could be
I told her I didn't see nobody
Why'd she make a fool out of me 

Then something struck me
As if it came from up above
While looking at the fortune teller
I fell in love

De ecos de su cuerpo que ya no esta
Presiento un adiós como una flor
Que se seca mal de tanto esperar

Y en este fuego yo la buscare
Besando las marcas sobre mi piel

Verano traidor devolvemela
Ella ya no sabe que me puede hacer
Beberé por mi amor, beberé de su ardor la sal
Pasara sin querer pasara sin pasar Ha Haaaaa

Como calienta el sol y sé que no estás
Me duele como un Dios la ciudad
Quisiera verla llorar, quisiera verla reír, como ayer
En el frío del mar la saldré a buscar
Tratando de llegar hasta el fin
No puedo verme llorar, quisiera solo gritar

Si el viento cayo tendrá una razón
Todo lo que vuelve no lleva  más
En un rayo de amor, en olas de dolor
Donde más se quema en el corazón
Y en esta prisión yo me moriré
Dejando las marcas en la pared

Beberé por mi amor, beberé de su ardor la sal

They've got a lonely house to hold together

His Playboy pictures turn him on
Her heart's so cold and lonely stone
Get big on and on and on there together

Together alone, together alone
They're at the house and they're not at home
Together alone

No angry words that they'll regret
They're never fuss or fighting yet
Sleep side by side but seldom get all together

They wanna plod outside of time
With them the maples gathered round
Someday they'll lie beneath the ground there together

Together alone, together alone
They're not unlike so many I've known
Together alone, together alone, together alone"

And the look in your eyes
As I dropped veil after veil
Was drunken desire
The dove calls and God notes it all 
The naked truth
Here is my veil the seventh and last
It will cost you

We can't last another second
For we are two, too lost for open doors
Take your memories and your ways
Let me see a brighter day
Greener fields aren't hard to hope for
It's just hard to go on living here without you

Somewhere I have dreamed
That you haven't got the time to be with me
Somewhere though it seems
That you have been making lovin' without me

Starshine, moonshine
You're the light that shines upon me baby
I know, you'll go
Find yourself another lover lady

Let me tell you how I feel
Loving others isn't real
You are blind
Too blind to notice
That their love is not the love we share together

Somewhere I have dreamed
That you haven't got the time to be with me
Somewhere though it seems
That you have been making lovin' without me

Starshine, moonshine
Your the light that shines upon me baby
I know, you'll go
Find yourself another lover lady

She was just always kinda there
She had a few nice features more or less
No red ribbons in her hair
Since that Jesse's been comin' to the diner
Folks are sayin' that she's never looked finer
She's got a different air

She's taken a shine to him
Becomin the woman that she's never been
And all of the guys are wishin they hadn't been so blind
She's taken a shine to life
Now there's a sparkle in her eye
They all missed a gem, the diamond within
She's taken a shine

Rosie hardly ever missed a bit of work
Never took vacation days
Home or the diner it was all the same to her
She didn't know any other way
But each afternoon now she starts to come alive
Cause Jesse's there each day to pick her up at five
You oughta hear them say

Oh what a little love can do
Now that she's found herself
She's stronger than she ever knew

She's taken a shiiiiiiiiiine
She's taken a shiiiiiiiiiine"

To give you all my love

Be strong enough
Give everything I am
And trust in love
My arms long to reach for you
The way I feel I wish you knew
I'm ready now, I'm ready to believe
Ooh, I'm ready for love

Only once, you will find
A love that is so true
And the way I think of you
You can't imagine how beautiful it feels

I must find a way to speak
This secret I hold near
Its these words

You need to hear
I'm ready to believe
Be strong enough
Give everything I am
And trust in love
My arms long to reach for you
The way I feel I wish you knew
I'm ready now, I'm ready to believe

I know with you I could stay forever
Sailing into grace
Here all things are possible
There's no time or space
When I feel you near

Raise my hands up to the sky

Far beyond the clouds
I'm asking help me,
Help me to see the world
Through baby eyes
And hold them closely.

On the rollercoaster
Made for coasting.

Time to make up,
Time to shake these memories.
It's time to leave the past

Lace up a new set of shoestrings.

And fought through what felt never ending.

My heart is mending.
I scream at sunsets.
Give applause to what I can't control
Then somehow laugh
At how the moon divides an ocean's soul.
I wanna be that ocean.
I wanna shine like that.
I wanna smile so big
My daughter jumps into my lap.
I wanna tell her daddy's fine
And always plans to be.
Then take her in my arms
This is what we'll always see.

And baby, let's go dancing.

Come on, let's go!

And their lives were sold to a new reality
And they'd all been told
That their hearts were cold to the twentieth century

And when your heart denied
Did you ever try to show them sympathy?
Stand back on your heels
And see how you feel in the face of charity

So if you don't see the signs in me
Look out for the kids of tragedy
You can trace that line in reality
To the kids, whoa, oh, oh of tragedy

Look back on your lives
Your memories are hiding the kids of tragedy
Fall down on your knees
If you try to please those forgotten kids of tragedy

You let them take the blame
But did you feel the shame for the things you let them do?
And when you made them a part
Of your reckless game, your talking won't do

So stand and admit you were wrong to forget
There were times they needed you
Those times when they lied
The envy of pride as it tried to face the truth

So if you can't see the signs in me
Look out for the kids of tragedy

And I say to the sleepy summer rain
With a complete absence of pain

But I'm still in love with you

Hide your eyes, hide your tears,
Hide your face, my love
Hide your ribbons, hide your bows
Hide your coloured cotton gloves
Hide your trinkets, hide your treasures
Hide your neatly scissored locks
Hide your memories, hide them all
Stuff them in a cardboard box
Or throw them into the street below
Leave them to the wind and the rain and the snow
For you might think I'm crazy
But I'm still in love with you

Call me up, baby, and I will answer your call
Call me up but remember I am no use to you at all

Now, you're standing at the top of the stairs
One hand on the banister, a flower in your hair
The other one resting on your hip
Without a solitary care
I fall to sleep in the summer rain
With no single memory of pain
And you might think I'm crazy

Even when I am driving in my car
Or you don't get a chance to leave the city very far
Keep focused on truth with meditation and prayer
Jah will show you you can go anywhere...

Walking through the woods with your backpack full of gear
Is fine, but realize that you've got to be aware
I know it's hard, and I'm glad to be there
But I will see so much more if my mind stays clear
Jah is speaking just listen to the birds

'Cause the plants and the animals are all messengers
So seek, and you will find relation
'Cause Jah earth and all in it, we are one creation

So be aware, and your mind must be clear
Under any circumstance Jah message you have to hear
No matter where you go, Jah is always there
So in the face of evil InI have no fear

Check it...
There were men who used to live that way
They didn't need guns or knives to survive in those days...
Till Babylon came with their false reality
The earth used to provide more than we could ever need
Now it seems like we're going the wrong way
""Forward ever, backwards never"" as the wise man say
Let us go back to the way they used to live
So the earth can be around for our children's kids

You know it makes him happy
Know how to give a thrill
So you do what you have to
Or some other woman will
You go down on him again
Do you hide inside yourself
So that you don't bother him
Do you laugh and shrug it off

Would you slit your throat to sate him

E credi che nei reality show sia tutto vero

Perché tutto è finto, perché tutto è finito
Sono troppo polemico ho testi implosi

Quando fai mille prove non dormi e non riposi
E ti ritrovi in questi alberghi lussuosi
Come Marco Pantani con in mano due dosi
E con gli occhi esplosi

För länge sen fördrivet. 

""Nu är det dags att glänta 
på dörren som har varit stängt. 
Som vargar ska vi äta 
ut i människans land."" 

Yxor i händerna, röttna tänder inn i munnen. 
Skocken samlas åt skogsbrynet till. 

Korparna skriker ur skogens mörka djup. 
""Grottans barn har kommit ut."" 

Efter tusen månen skrider gruppen framåt mat. 
Ingen kan nu hejda den här hungern. 

Bort ännu, men närmare än igår. 
Hör hur de sjunger... 

Grottans Barn! 
Hungriga Vargar! 
Brottans Barn! 

Korparna skriker ur skogens mörka djup. 
""Grottans barn har äntligen kommit ut."""

È lui che mi spinge dentro, questo vento
Congela il rumore tra gli alberi

Solo il buio è qui per me
È lui che mi parla adesso
Come il vuoto intorno
Acceca ogni silenzio

Adesso resto qui, fermo e fragile
Mi ritrovo tra le frasi di un libro senza pagine
E quella pelle che non sa rimpiangere
La dovrei perdere, cambiare, lacerare
E ritrovare l'aria

Cosa resta qui per me
Di questi sbiaditi riflessi
Frammenti di giorni
Continuano a disfarsi

Adesso resto qui, solo e fragile
Vedo scorrere le frasi
Di un libro senza pagine

Che non trattiene in me
La voglia di cambiare, lacerare ogni silenzio
E ritrovare finalmente la mia aria"

And watch you walk out on me
See the tears one by one
They fall down my hard head
Forevermore

Fall around into the ground
Deep down
Far as you can

Go out tonight and meet the dawn again
It'd be nice to see an old friend
Learn to accept the things I am
I never liked myself before
Now even less
When it rains it pours
Down my hard head forever more

Fall down into the ground
Deep down
Far as you can
Who was I kidding?

Oh, your record label hasn't come through yet
You've gained some weight
And all you can think is
When the Romeo's gonna show
Oh, and I know, babe,

I would if I could
Fuck it all

Your brother feeds you

Met the divine Miss O

Messed around with that big guy

Men, prepare for death, 'cause we might never return

Blood will spill and heads will fall
As the swords sparkle, lights the night
The ground rumbles as we attack
In the throes of rage, we will fight
The lightning's flash, the thunder's roar
Will petrify the weak
We'll show no mercy, we'll kill them all!

There's a time, there's a place for me
In a world where I can't be found
Cold and mean people give me the creeps

Going to the jungle where the elephant roams
Got to get away, gonna make it my home

Losing my taste for the human race
Social grace is a waste of time
It's absurd when I look around
So sublime that we blow my mind

Naked in the rain with a killer whale
I can't taste the salt when I lick his tail

Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle, what's your secret?
Give it to me doctor, don't keep it

I never met an animal that I didn't like
You can come to me, I won't bite
Don't you know dog is man's best friend?
There is some love that you can't fight

Naked in the rain with black tattoos
Running through the woods, laughing at the blues

Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle, what's your secret?
Give it to me doctor, don't keep it

Listen to the talking heart in my chest
With this gift, good Lord, I am blessed
There's a lump and it's in my throat
I'm in love with the wilderness

Naked in the river, skinny dipping my way
In the waterfall, I just wanna play

Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle, what's your secret?
Give it to me doctor, don't keep it

Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle, what's your secret?
Give it to me doctor, don't keep it"

Filled with secrets she hid
And in a dusty old attic, one mornin I read
About a woman I never met
Who had dreams just like mine
With every page that I turned, the words came alive

Wish I could roll out of town like a run-away train
I'll do as I dare, let them call me insane
I'll never sit on the sidelines of life, I'll dance every dance
If I just had the chance

A tear fell on that faded page
Cause this was somebody else
Not the mama I knew who never thought of herself
But the times, they were different then
And lines just didn't get crossed
And these words that she wrote, they somehow got lost

Wish I could roll out of town like a run-away train
I'll do as I dare, let them call me insane
I'll never sit on the sidelines of life, I'll dance every dance
If I just had the chance

The chance that she never had
Is now the gift that is mine
And out here on this road, I'm makin' up for lost time
Yeah, I am my mother's child
And tonight in this car
I've got her words in my suitcase and her dreams in my heart

As I roll out of town like a run-away train
I'll do as I dare, let them call me insane

That told you just what I should be

With all the ones that went before 
And memories that always seems to 
Tear me from my mind 
In front of what it is you seem me to be

Between a way to win or a thing to lose

For they must change now or before I burst,

But could you even understand my pain
Watching, what is it in your brain that never gets it?
One day I'll disappear to the answer locked in my
Head that you'll never see of feel,
A consumer

The more the body is pierced, tortured, wounded, humiliated
The more complete his man's victory over pain,
The greater man victory over pain,
The greater his victory over the flesh.

That people are a plague
No sympathy
No liability
They drain my life
We'll see the life they're living
Once I stop all I'm doing for them."

Y que la calma me besa el corazón
Os quiero decir adiós
Porque ha llegado la hora
De que andéis el camino ya sin mí
¡Hay tanto por lo que vivir

No llores cielo y vuélvete a enamorar
Me gustaría volver a verte sonreír
Pero mi vida, yo nunca podré olvidarte
Y sólo el viento sabe
Lo que has sufrido por amarme
Hay tantas cosas
Que nunca te dije en vida
Que eres todo cuanto amo
Y ahora que ya no estoy junto a ti
Te cuidaré desde aquí

Sé que la culpa os acosa
Y os susurra al oído ""pude hacer más""
No hay nada que reprochar

Ya no hay demonios
En el fondo del cristal, y sólo bebo
Todos los besos que no te di

Pero mi vida, yo nunca podré olvidarte
Y sólo el viento sabe
Lo que has sufrido por amarme
Hay tantas cosas
Que nunca te dije en vida
Que eres todo cuanto amo
Y ahora que ya no estoy junto a ti

Vivo cada vez que habláis de mí
Y muero otra vez si lloráis
He aprendido al fin a disfrutar
Y soy feliz
No llores cielo y vuélvete a enamorar
Nunca me olvides
Me tengo que marchar

Pero mi vida, yo nunca podré olvidarte
Y sólo el viento sabe
Lo que has sufrido por amarme
Hay tantas cosas
Que nunca te dije en vida
Que eres todo cuanto amo
Y ahora que ya no estoy junto a ti

Desde mi cielo os arroparé en la noche
Y os acunaré en los sueños
Y espantaré todos los miedos
Desde mi cielo os esperaré escribiendo
No estoy sólo pues me cuidan
La Libertad y la Esperanza

Seperate the weak from the ob-solete
Hard to creep them Brooklyn streets

I can hear sweat trickling down your cheek
Your heartbeat soun like Sasquatch feet
Thundering, shaking the concrete
Finish it, stop, when I foil the plot
Neighbors call the cops said they heard mad shots
Saw me in the drop, three in the corner

Slaughter, electrical tape around your daughter
Old school new school need to learn though
I burn baby burn like Disco Inferno
Burn slow like blunts with llello
Peel more skins than Idaho potato
Niggaz know, the lyrical molestin is takin' place
Fuckin' with B.I.G. it ain't safe

This old block before
I've walked into
Abruptly closin' doors
Schooled in hard knocks; I've learned a lot
'Bout how a heart can break
I might not know what love is
But I know what it ain't

It ain't layin in the dark and wonderin' why she hasn't called
And now it's 2 AM
It ain't drivin' by her house to find her wrapped up in the arms
Of your ex-best friend
It ain't bold face lies or alibies that cannot be explained
I might not know what love is
But I know what it ain't

You say you could
Show me how to love
Baby there's one thing
You can be sure of
I wouldn't treat you wrong 'cause I've been on
The hurtin' side of pain
I might not know what love is
But I know what it ain't

It ain't showin' up for dinner with a rose and Chardonnay
Then drinkin' by yourself
It ain't a postcard from Hawaii sayin' we can still be friends
But I met someone else
It ain't bold faced lies or alibis that cannot be explained
I might not know what love is
But I know what it ain't

It ain't a mink coat,
Forty pairs of shoes,
Two 14-carat anklets on my Mastercard.
It ain't walkin' in a pawn shop,
Recognizing her engagement ring,
She swore she lost.
It ain't bold face lies or alibis,
That cannot be explained.
I might not know what love is,
But I know what it ain't.

If you had all day I could tell you things
That would make a grown man faint
I might not know what love is
But I know what it ain't
Yeah, I know what it ain't"

She wouldn't trade it in, with none of she thangs

Well now she might of caught my ass like once or twice
But she'd rather stick with me, instead of rolling the dice
'Cause she know I'm official, so why take a chance
And end up with a over jealous sucka' romance
Love to see me get the lap dance every now and then huh
Never fuck around with her stripper girlfriends huh
Now that's living like, who's the boss

Como una oleada
Que me amó violentamente

Vi sobre mi amor desgarrador
Un signo extraño.

Vi sobre mi piel una inicial

Strutting with her head up in the clouds

In glossy magazines for girls and boys
Airheads, nothing in between

Empty boxes making lots of noise
Ok! Hello!
Gotta get up I gotta go
Paris, London, Tokyo, New York

She was front-page news on the Daily Blah
Kiss and tell with a superstar
Someone should have told her not to talk
Yesterday she ran away
From the paparazzi lens
Is that the way to make new friends

In glossy magazines for girls and boys
Airheads, nothing in between

Keep on falling in love

Now I don't mind
All this running around
Seems I've been doing it
Most of my life
My music's been kind
But some days I find
It brings me two kinds of trouble
And three kinds of strife

So don't try to compare it
'Cause I just want to
Share it with some people
I like to call friends
There ain't nothing bad and
No need to feel sad
And there's certainly no need
To make amends

It won't do you no harm and
There's no cause for alarm
I won't be praying for
Help from above
If the only thing
Wrong with rock and roll
Is that I keep on falling in love

Is that I keep on falling

It blows a cool breeze in the air
Of thoughts and shimmering hours of May
And all its feelings

I dared to walk down by the lane
Calm and fearless in the rain
I felt that you were by my side
Calm and tender

You are the reason for this May
Has washed the purple clouds away

You are the reason for this May
Has washed the purple clouds away

You are the reason for this May
Is warm and fills me with its rays

Listen, all the time we witness miracles,
All the time!

We thought that anyone that has a life
Bear the cross of the passion and of the time
Oh, the way I was blind!

The time I stumbled over your blue eyes
I felt like falling into a pool of joy
And a sort of miracle happened
The ancient fortress vanished at your smile

You are the reason for this May
Has blown all darkness far away

Is warm and fills me with its rays"

Don't deny that lonely feeling
That keeps stealing on you from deep down inside
Hey, can't you see that it's no good concealing
A feeling it hurts you to hide

When you can come home to me
Yes, I'm happy to hear what you've got
To say to me, baby, all the way
Girl, you can count on me
Watch those shadows fade away
And brighten your night with my day

Daybreak, sunset hot and cold
Running smiles and tears
A bright outside to match your foolish pride
But not a word for the lonely years

Please come back to me
Now you won't have to say
That you'll stay with me, baby, no, it's not that way
Just come back home to me
Watch those shadows fade away
And brighten your night with my...

Inside a chapel praying
My conscience I'll be saving

Open the gates of the past
With the key to our hearts
Dream of the years gone by
Centuries through mankind's eyes

In the wasteland that grows inside
Within me I shall find myself

Slowly walking, pacing front
See through these blind eyes
Stepping on shadows, touching air
Stones move as I stand still
Seek the answers in the skies
As we don't even know ourselves
Silent, as the sun sets before our eyes

In the wasteland that grows inside
Within me I shall find myself

For years of space technology
Still we haven't learned
Like children we explore
Things we can't yet comprehend

Open the doors of the past
With the beating of a heart
Dream as the years go by
Carrying our own cross
Seek the answers in the skies

It's good to know the Lord.

I love the Lord, He heard my cry,
And He pitied every groan.

I'll hasten to His throne.

You promised it's the end
Just one night you'll be fine

Are all you ever were

Come on lets die until we live

There's no design to ever bring you down

My man Tom introduced us but I was too shy to say hi
When I finally built up enough nerve to drop a line
You made it clear you wasn't just another MySpace mistress

And I didn't take it personal
When you ignored my request to be your friend I spilled my guts and hit send
Waited 2 weeks for a response and got nothing
Honestly it only made me want you more

Week 4 rolled around and I was this close to letting go
But something wouldn't let me even though I hardly knew you
It was plain to see we were meant to lock lips
You knock me out with the brass knuckle tats on your hips

I was on this website late night lurking
When I got a message from you that was labeled urgent
You said you weren't impressed by lame dudes with no game
They're all the same tryin' to get your instant messenger name

But the fact that you hittin' me back made me smile
You must've saw somethin' you liked when you was skimming through my profile
You caught me at the most pivotal moment
So now I'm emailing my love with a dozen digital roses

So click approve, so simple
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose

Just click approve, you're killin' me here
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose

Let's face it, it's a sad situation when we have to resort to keyboards as a means of making relations
But I don't have the patience, I get straight to the point
So this is me at my most honest
No egos, no Gym Class status, just Travis

Love it or leave it, but you gotta admit
On a scale of one to awesome I'm the shit
Just get over it, it happened god damn it, I've been waitin too long
Even wrote a song about, like to hear it, here it go
If I'm being too annoying, let me know (just let me know)

But it's hard for me to not hate when I'm on MySpace
I never see my face in your Top 8
Approaching 6 weeks now, it's kinda obvious that you're either occupied or playing a game
All my money's on the latter, this is not a LOL matter
Why would you pass up a chance this great?

If there were two forces and I split them down the middle, I could swing back and forth for 3 days
Rephrase
If I had two horses, and I beat them with authority, I'd gallop all the way to Canada to see your face
But all I got is this Powerbook and iChat

Besides I hit you all the time and you never write back
I stay on my feet
Shit
And be persistent till my name is under who you would like to meet

So click approve, so simple
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose

Just click approve, you're killin' me here
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose

Who cares if we don't know each other's last name
All I know is that I'm smitten with your pictures wishin' you would feel the same
I admit I get a little jealous when other dudes leave you comments
Don't let it gas you up, it's all nonsense

Lately I been romancing the thought of me and you speaking in tongues in this mansion I bought
But it's all wishful thinking
Just give me some kind of sign to let me know I'm not freakin' you out
And if you lovin' what I'm speaking about, then say something

I check my inbox ten times and ain't nothin'
You probably busy doing something sexy
I just hope I'm in your thoughts next time you log in
And if not, ain't no love lost between you and me
I'll be here when your man ain't fully down as he used to be
So yeah it's time to sign out, my vision's getting blurry
This is madness, XOXO dash Travis

So click approve, so simple
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose

Just click approve, you're killin' me here

I ain't braggin, folks draggin me up and down the road
To be fucked up when I gets into my clownin mode
Then go to clown up on they ass like Bozo
Oh no, then dance on top of they asses like I was Jo Jo Dancer
Come Comet, come Dasher, come Prancer
Come niggaz with machine guns, I think that is the answer
But the question 'Should we take that bullshit from them people?'
I'm makin' 300 on my SAT and I am equal
Ain't no sequel, no saga, no way out, I'm nervous
I've had it up to fo'head of niggaz tryin' to serve us
To graduate is really becomin a very stressful journey
I feel like a steering wheel, for them is tryin' to turn me
Into a hate monger, and I'm wishin and I wonder
Damn, will I graduate before I hit the summer
I think not, Officer Friendly tryin' to dig up in me
He said I'm half assed and got no future
And so he sent me up the creek and shit
Strokin like hell without no paddle
But niggaz is gettin' smart, we back on the saddle
No longer, y'all know y'all had us down for some years
It's the call of da wild nigga, uh, there it is

Chorus: Cee-Lo

I hear voices in my head and they keep callin me (repeat 4X)

(T-Mo)
As I step, the stage is empty
No words as I serve with my Southern dialect, so I get respect
Don't call me T, it's a T thang with a G swang
Let my nuts hang down to the flo' main
Smokin' that dang dang, makin' mics swang
In my 2-8-0 Z, nobody can see me
Cruisin down the block, just like I was a squirrel
In a world full of nuts, damn
I'd probably be mad even if I called him Uncle Sam
So bring dough to the Goodie Mo-B
T-Mo, Khujo, Cee-Lo, J and my homie rather be
Don't flex on next, I break necks too
Rollin' with Outkast, PA, Goodie Mob for the 94
Ha-ha-ha
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?

(Big Boi)
Yeah, I'm steady buckin muthafuckas
Not duckin 'em like the goose, I'm heavily strapped, yeah niggaz
Squeezin rhymes like that noose around your neck
You can't hang with this, see ain't no thangs to this
I show no pity so take off because I'm dangerous
I breaks 'em off like I was Beat Street, see I be breakin
Speakin' of breakin, break on how to get your life taken, boy
Fuckin' around with me will get your cabbage cut, your wig split
Simply means I'm bringin' the funk with the hollow tips
Playa shit is how I'm kickin it
Comin' around the ghetto, victims soft as a tack on a jackass
So fuck it or flip it, I'll still be a playa
Puffy afro with nigga naps off in my hair
Shit, that's quickly how I run my shit and that's how it be
That nigga B-I-G B-O-I, that be me, ye
See I'm a playa, got my struggle on
Thinkin' about the volume and thickness of my bankroll
You see that cash is in my shit like colon cancer
Even though I never smoke that shit like... yeah
I give a call of da wild to my niggaz around the projects
So don't flex or get served with a pop neck shit
OG, original gangsta, not quite
But maybe when I'm locked up, liftin weights, gettin' swole right
Life's a bitch with a G-string 'cause these off in your ass with it hey
So you can see who can really hang
But y'all don't wanna do nothin', y'all can go to hell
Ain't no playas in office 'cause I'm locked off in a cell
So can you feel me, nigga

(Khujo)
Khujo, comin' in dope, bring it
I got more problems than the average Joe
So don't come 'round me with your flim flam, hot damn
It's a jack, top of the burbs, and my notebook is a bird
K's madness into cappin
Throwin' to do more load, so my fire lookin' through the want ads
And only red hot, desire in your pot with somethin' wicked
But you can't feel it, stickin out your monkey ass
I could let shit rot in the past, now it's time to blast they ass
Shhh... Mr. Knighton take off your hat
Can't even my wear my locs in
Demon eye scopin, oh my, peripheral vision got it
Made you go on your hoe's bar
Decisions, decisions to make, oops, here comes the Goodie Mo crew
And they just might want to battle you
Out with the quickness
The price of livin' is beginning to be a risky business
Unkay, Parkay.
How do you like the taste of hot butter meltin through your biscuits?
This is your brain on drugs, this is your brain...
Don't cut niggaz I hang with before there were apartments
In Chapel Forest, it's gettin' horrid

I stood up and started moving with a childlike fascination
For those doors that don't have locks and the stairways that were blocked
So I dug through the obstruction, put my fist around the railing

And each step was far apart and far away from steps before it
And the air was getting thinner 'til I couldn't breathe at all
And if I happened to look behind me there were miles and miles of stairs
Enough so I couldn't see the doorway but I knew that it was there

And on the last step I was dizzy 'cause there were stairs in all directions
But I found another door and through the door there was the attic
Without old clothes, without a ceiling, everything had opened wide
Into the jaws of something bigger and suddenly I saw that I was

Upstairs and outside and
Freezing on the roof
Finally it had found me
The answer, the feeling and the truth

That I'm small
That I'm small
That I'm small
I'm smaller than the smallest fireball"

There out on the move, ga, ga, god knows where

The sinful ways of wickedness
Alluring power of decadence

And went berserk?'

Fed a cycle bound by dilemma-debting vendetta
Escaped briefly back to my apartment
I parked in front the fan
And reminisce about the day I ran a mile with your heart in my

'Tesants get the New York home game
With real life shoot-em-up action
Thug, vagrant, yuppie, and art
Free game piece all included
I told this cat the earth was flat
He walked till his beard grew long enough to strangle himself
For being stupid
Brick-a-brak novelty
Spliced with that sixth pack odyssey
Godspeed Tequila worm future, be concerned
My feelings spread across the land reporting avalanche sightings
While my introverted side is flying cadavers on kite strings
I'ma never give, I'm juiced off ejection
I'm stubborn as a thousand born-against avoiding questions
From the alpha to the zed
I bake the date up for my pledge
To 'bay the traitor in the twice-forgotten favors that he bled
Not a creature stirred, it reeks of subway metal
Bevel-edge journalist chin on fish shenanigans
Recording mayhem with bonuses, benefits and break room
Mummified mannequins with future cleanse adamant
And skeleton in cabinet
This amalgam circus, got a ring of fire
Just big enough to shove my purpose in a circle
I'm known to dip dusk in a broken city curfew
Release the hounds and see which one can tractor trail and serve you (SUCKA!)
I lay the law down upon its belly
With my foot dug in between the third and fourth disk
Yelling 'Break yo'self!'

I'm the actualized data commission
Past penny tip jar donation arrangement
Rather far-fetched from stability
Took a heart pledge early on
Bled onto the drum doser
Plow in the metronome, home
Lone caddy corner to cock-eyed sound booster
Sensationally seismograph stabbin away on stone tablets
To sketch up out your future
I drifted out the main spelunking unit with watered down sand
But have canceled developed, courtesy America
Land of the free base
Home of the triplicate grill character
My sorta sideways tilt called pinball blinker
It citizens wander through ex-warrants steady bleed
With dilapadated winter jacket
I rock a crooked lid piece

Pacifist willing to step into a friend's beef if needed
Wing clipper, I hierarch compassionate
Where they whine on some 'Daddy's gonna kill Ralphy' shit
Sucked the proverbial silver spoon to the parents quit
Apparently
Parasol spinnin casually like 'I'm an artist, please don't laugh
At me'
Ok, time to buckle the fuck down
Side of the wobbly system back to original form, pumpkin
You can catch the memoir in several dimensions
The joy of life logic, don't employ the spite process
Hence, your plight botches

Just how small I am and how tall You are

yo cierro los ojos y veo tu cara
que sonríe cómplice de amor
días en la carretera
yo siento aquí dentro
la emoción de haber
dejado lo mejor
yo no se si en verano éste amor
aquí no hay luces de escena
y algo en mi no se serena, no
yo ya no comprendo nada
tantas caras dibujadas
como manchas en una pared
noches de melancolía
pateando en una ciudad vacía
en la oscuridad te busco a vos
quizás hoy si te pueda encontrar
mas allá de toda pena
siento que la vida es buena hoy
yo se que no es en vano este amor
mas allá de toda pena
siento que la vida es buena hoy."

Many days you have lingered around my cabin door

While we seek mirth and beauty
And music light and gay
There are frail ones fainting at the door
Though their voices are silent
Their pleading looks will say
Oh, hard times come again no more

Hard times... hard times come again no more
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door

'Tis a sigh that is wafted across the troubled wave
'Tis a wail that is heard upon the shore
'Tis a dirge that is murmured around the lowly grave

Overwhelmed by laughter

Starry skies of stains
Ultimately sorry
Uneducated random strokes of pain

It's a chain going backwards through the veins
Must sew up this wound and run away

I can feel their strength
Through crooked-lightning desert pathways

Run and run and run the pathways
Branching off through time

The utmost silence of the time

The trouble started in cell block no. 4
It spread like fire across the prison floor
I said "";Come on boys, get ready to run
Here comes the warden with a tommy gun""

There's a riot goin' on
There's a riot goin' on
There's a riot goin' on
Up in cell block number nine

The warden said
"";Come out with your hands up in the air
If you don't stop this riot (or: You gonna start a riot ?)
You're all gonna get the chair""
Scarface Jones said, "";It's too late to quit
And pass the dynamite, 'cause the fuse is lit""

There's a riot goin' on
There's a riot goin' on
There's a riot goin' on

The ninety-second hour
The tear gas got our men
Crawled in our cells
But every now and then...

There's a riot goin' on

You hide your face from me

It's your old man on the line.

Well I ain't talking 'bout the dress you're wearing
Ain't talking 'bout the thing in your hair
Ain't talking 'bout the kooch your daring
Ain't talking 'bout the love your sharing
I'm talking 'bout the things you do to me

It's a waste of time
I don't even have to fight
Here all by myself
Just waiting for you to pass by
And the things you're talking 'bout are crazy
You know

Ain't talking 'bout your breasts or thighs
Ain't talking 'bout that look in your eyes
Ain't talking 'bout your big shoe size
Ain't talking what you do to other guys
I'm talking 'bout the things you do to me.

And like any other guy
I've got sex on the brain.
But it's a bit more complicated.
There's a way that you show me a sign
Something else gets elevated.
Yeah - yeah

We've been gladly exempt we are racked with contempt
And we happily wish you this hurt
My skull is on fire with barbs and black spires
My synapses shriek in the flames
Yet we reel with desire though chocked by coarse wire
We've been loosed by our raging disdain

I'm gone, God help me I'm done
Nothing can stop me, I'm done

No fear no doubt I've bottomed out I've lost myself I'm letting go
No pride no me I've set them free I've lost my mind and now I know
No pain no death they're put to rest we leave them here we close the door
No earth no man, now take my hand nothing matters anymore

Oh the stage that we soil, the plans that we foil
The joke that we play on the world
And you drown in the oil, all wrapped up in the coils
Crushed under the stones that you've hurled
Still we march through the tombs through the darkness and gloom
And we shatter the columns of bone
And the world she breaks for the lives that she takes
She weeps as she dies all alone

The world is a husk to be peeled back and torn
My body a shell that now breaks
How I long to escape from the chains that I've worn
And hasten my greatest escape
And when I breathe my very last
Don't shed a tear for me
Discard the body that once was my prison
For I'll have been set free

And when the trumpets call us home and I am no longer bedded by pain
Our tears will be forever dried for the author of life knows my name
So we trample the hoards of the pointless and blank
We will die for the truth in our hearts
No force that exists will steal us from his hands
Nothing will tear us apart

Though the mirror is dull, the reflection obscured we look beyond the obtuse
And the world weighs down, beating us to the ground
But her efforts are of little use
The anointed one has purchased our souls death is battered and lifeless before me
The truth rains down for the children of Christ and the truth has set us free
And through it all we rise when we fall
Though the road grows more narrow before me
Though we ache though we cry never break, never die
The one truth there is sets us free"

And sit and nurse my broken heart

I know I'm ready for your love, I just don't understand it
There is a silent pact of trust that I never could admit
That I never could

So now I'm telling you the reason I'm all messed up
Just have to look me in the eyes and I fall apart
Please let me hold you 'til I know we are both through this
I couldn't lead another day without you here in my arms

You look so fragile I could break but I try to hold myself
Together for the both of us but in truth I'm just as scared
I just wanna watch you sleep as you lie here beside me
So close your eyes I'll guard the door and when you wake
You'll wake with me and when you wake you'll

6465,TRAYXZF128F425D645.h5,Johnny Cash,A Boy Named Sue,"Well, my daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to Ma and me
Just this ole guitar and an empty bottle of booze

Now, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me Sue

Well, he musta thought that it was quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from lots a folks
Seems I had to fight my whole life through

Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I'll tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I roamed from town to town to hide my shame

But I made me a vow to the Moon and stars
I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man that give me that awful name

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I'd just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew

At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table dealin' stud
Sat the dirty, mangey dog that named me Sue

Well I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn out picture that my mother had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye

He was big and bent and grey and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold, and I said
""My name is Sue!  How do you do?  Now you gonna die!""
Yeah!  That's what I told him

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down but to my surprise
Came up with a knife an' cut off a piece of my ear

I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kickin' and a-gougin' in the mud and the blood and the beer

I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile

Well, I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun but I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

And he said, ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it he's gotta be tough
And I know I wouldn't be there to help you along

So I gave you that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's that name that helped to make you strong""

Yeah!  He said, ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me and ya got the right
To kill me now and I wouldn't blame you if you do

But you oughta thank me before I die
For the gravel in your guts and the spit in the eye
'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue""
Yeah, what could I do?  What could I do?

I got all choked up and threw down my gun
Called him my Pa and he called me his son
And I come away with a different point of view

And I think about him now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George, any-damn-thing but Sue!  I still hate that name!"

Boom bash dash, I had to break, I had to getaway
Packed my bags, to leave for good, it was a Monday
Kissed my mother, gave my pops a pound
Then he hugged me, and then he turned around
I threw the duffelbag over my shoulder
It was time to get props kid, cause now I'm older
Time to fend for myself jack
So I'ma go for mine, and maybe never come back
Stopped at the lye spot before I hit the train station
Needed some boom for the mental relaxation
It took the last of my loot to make this move Troop
But I ain't even tryin' to work in a suit
Plus my aunt's got a room that's for rent
As long as there's no hoes and I don't come home bent
So fuck the bullshit I'm audi
I'm on a mission, 'cause if I stay I'll go crazy
I'm gonna make it god damnit
Out in B-R-double-O-K-Lyn, The Planet
They never fake it just slam it
Out in B-R-O-O-K-Lyn, The Planet

Crash boom bang I used to hang at Four Corners
And all the spots in Beantown where niggaz carry burners
But I was more turned on by the micraphone
So one cold morning, I left home
Next I'm smokin' blunts on?
Or workin in a mail room Uptown, feelin' sick and
Tired, of payin' all these fucked up dues
I wasn't tryin' to lose -- I refused
Had a chick Uptown, one in Queens and one in Jersey
Sometimes all you need to get by, is a girlie
But yo I still wasn't happy
I seen a lot of ill shit on my block, happen nightly
East New York is no joke kid
And peace to my man Hass doin' his bad
I went to Flatbush to buy incense and weed
Stopped at the bookstands for somethin' to read
That shit was rough cause my pockets was bare
And like the sayin' goes, sometimes life ain't fair
But in my heart there ain't no quittin
So I stayed up late, to write some rhymes to some rhythms
Seconds away from just flippin
But fuckit I'll maintain, one day I'll be hittin
See I'ma make it god damnit
Out in B-R-double-O-K-Lyn, The Planet
I'll never fake it just slam it
There in B-R-O-O-K-Lyn, The Planet

And you can, walk the walk talk the talk but don't flaunt
Cause little shorty's scheamin on your rings and fronts
But don't sweat it, cause that's the life out here
A lot of niggaz, be livin' real trife out here
I got my own place in Bed-Stuy
Known to many others, as Do or Die
Malcolm X Boulevard and Gates Avenue
Smokin' up the fat trey bags with the crew
Me and the niggaz Troy and Squeaky
Used to twist Dutch Masters, we got nice weekly
I used to build with the brothers by the spot
They had to hustle but they still knew a lot
To get my haircut had to go to Fort Greene
On Myrtle Ave, to get a fade with the sides clean
Then to Fulton just to look around
Just to roam around, and find a chick to go Uptown
And check a movie or some shit like that
I couldn't spend much but yo my game was fat
I remember this one chick, she brought me a beeper
Then one week later, she got me some sneakers
But then I stepped, 'cause I found out about her rep
And I ain't goin' out bein no bitch's pet
But anyway I used to lay up in the crib
Listening to Red and Marley, wishin I was on kid
Saved my dough, stayed on the down low
Lounged and drank 40's with Tommy, Hill and Gunsmoke
And Lil' Dap used to come by strapped
Nice off a L 'cause we stayed like that
Sometimes I used to miss my moms
Gunshots in the twilight, people fightin every night
But I'ma be aight still
'Cause I'ma keep writin shit and perfectin my skills
I'm gonna make it god damnit
Here in B-R-double-O-K-Lyn, The Planet
I never fake it just slam it
Here in B-R-O-O-K-Lyn, The Planet *echoes*"

A wound unhealing

If time will set you free...

Time now to spread your wings
To take to flight
The life endeavor
Aim for the burning sun
You're trapped inside
But you can still be free...
If time will set you free...
But it's a long long way to go

Keep moving way up high
You see the light
It shines forever
Sail through the crimson skies
The purest light
The light that sets you free...
If time will set you free...

Sail through the wind and rain tonight
You're free to fly tonight
And you can still be free...
If time will set you free...

And go high like the wind don't stop
And go high
Hoo

Si hablamos de matar mis palabras matan
No hace mucho tiempo que cayo el Leon Santillan
Y ahora se que en cualquier momento me la van a dar

(Mah matador, mah matador) Donde estas matador
(Mah matador, mah matador)

Me dicen el matador me estan buscando
En una fría pension los estoy esperando
Agazapado en lo mas oscuro de mi habitacion
Fusil en mano, espero mi final

Matador, oh yeah (matador, matador)

Viento de libertad sangre combativa
En los bolsillos del pueblo la vieja herida
De pronto el dia se me hace de noche
Murmullos, corridas aquel golpe en la puerta
Llego la fuerza policial

(Mah matador, mah matador)
Mira hermano en que terminaste
Por pelear por un mundo mejor
Que suenan, son balas
Me alcanzan, me atrapan, resiste

(Matador, matador) Matador te esta buscando
(Matador, matador) matador te estan matando
Matador, oh yeah (matador, matador)
Valiente matador

Me dicen el matador de los 100 barrios porteños
No tengo por que tener miedo mis palabras son balas
Balas de paz, balas de justicia
Soy la voz de los que hicieron callar sin razon
Por el solo hecho de pensar distinto, ay Dios
Santa Maria de los Buenos Aires si todo estuviera mejor

(Matador, matador) Si todo estuviera mejor
(Matador, matador) a donde vas matador

I've got a rebuilt carburetor

I've got brand new spark plug wires

I'be been clutchin and a brakin

I've been up these hills and down

Her good love keeps me makin'

That Asheville turnaround



I've been working like the dickens

Trying to make a livin'

Just waitin for the weed to end

I try to pay attention

But it's hard to keep from thinkin'

Bout bein' in her arms again

There ain't a woman finer

Than the one in Carolina

At the top of Black Mountain Road

Friday comes around

I'll pour some coffee down

And buddy I'll be good to go



Now three hundred four

And a half miles one way

Puts me on her front pourch steps

I know what I got comin'

The kissin' and a huggin'

About as good as any man can get

For two days and two nights

Everthing's all right

Happy as a hardwood tree

The only thing wrong

When Sunday comes along

I've got to rocket back to Tennessee

After last chorus:

Just can't let her down

She's the best girl I have found

I make that Ashville turnaround."

It's like I got the 4-4 cocked
On the block in it two door dropped
And my spot is keepin' but hot
The pussy-ass cop throw some murder in the lot
My nigga got popped with a bullet that was meant for me
The adapt by T's and B's and the regencies
Fuck what the reason be, I'ma start squeezin these
Them niggas ain't G's, they wanna be thugs
And it ain't shit, these ain't no motherfuckin slugs
The fools and plugged plus ain't no hoes over here
I done dropped more dead bodies than tears
Brought to life momma's worst fears
Pictures of a son dyin' from that hot ones flyin
Baby mama's cryin at the funeral
Cause the magnum lit him like a Black and Mild
When I rolled out on his ass on the solo
I caught him up on mo-mo cookin up co-co
I got to tip on the low-low
Bust it there like po-po takin' lives with the, oh no
It's a 4-4, mini-missile with a silencer for the whistle
My favorite pistol, 'cause when I let that bitch ride
I know the homicide is being carried out in official
Niggas steady bumpin guns, but don't want none
Because of these hot ones that explode on contact
A manic that's prepared to die in combat
Besides all that a 4-4 keeps me laced, don't be petty to say
I can see the fear in your face
As I reach my waist for this warm embrace

I got plenty love for the 4-4
But when I pick it up, I don't wanna let it go
Because a nigga straight lovin' your warm embrace
I got plenty love for the 4-5
But when I pick it up, I don't wanna let it ride
But still I bust 'cause I survive from your warm embrace
I got plenty love for the nine-mill
And when I pick it up, I don't really wanna kill
But still I bust because I'm needin' your warm embrace
All you muthafuckas better duck and hide
Before I let it ride, the sucka stepped aside
Still I bust because I'm lovin' your warm embrace

(Mayz)
I love the element of surprise when I'm taking these hoes lives
With my customized 4-5
Get enough ammunition to knock off you, your crew and some more guys
You muthafuckas better get wise
Make sure your first shot is sweet, tryin' to kill the elite
Cause you ain't gettin' no more tries
Hate to make a nubian mother weap, but fuck it
Long as I don't hear the hoe cry
Split a beam between his eyes and make that bitch nigga so wise
No matter what the size of the warm embrace of my forty-five
Make sure the nigga crossed through dies
You don't wanna throw them thangs
'Cause when I cocked and aim it's time to think in a split second time
But Mayz ain't new to the game
I use the spark when the shots light up this thunderin crime
But niggas get bucked for dime and it's like you're a magnet for sin
Punk pretend to be your friend till they get close enough to your ends
To do you in, that shit puts me on ten
And make me wanna put the barrel of this solid fiend
Upon under that nigga's chin, plus he talkin' big shit about war
Like he don't know my Speedknot Mob gon' win
But I dare one of you niggas to say my name
'Cause I put a fuckin' bullet into your closest kin
Just to get under your skin like a dirty syringe
Plus I know you can't win with a gun or a pin
So when you see Mayz come in the place you better say your grace
Before I fuck up your face like a can of mace
Before I get disgraced, I'ma catch a case
Maybe you hoes fear the wrath of my warm embrace

(Twista)
With you my passion, nina squeeze off seventeen, for sure
Hold you ever so tightly, I love you nina and never wanna let you go
Miss Millimeter's makin' a mockery of motherfuckers gotsta be ruckus
When I get my clutches upon this hoe
Itchin' to let the barrel blow
Like a sparrow, how it flow, like an arrow, geronimo
Spit 'em up and swallow slow
I reload, clippin' your ass crack, you constantly blast back
Payback from flashback, some bitches know
Bust till I see the chrome from the intro
You was fucked from the phasin', deep with the cuts and abrasion
Erupts and amazin', nigga, my nina bucked
Fuck the gazin and enemies get tore up from the blazin'
Fool you be burnin' them with your black ass
Murderous hips, hurtin' the grips, ride on personal list
Deposition die for servin' them six
Everyone of 'em with a hit but some are missin' of a jerk to the kick
'Cause I be working my bitch
Tryin' to pimp her but she a wild and a tame thang
Kick a static on when she gangbang, blast in the fullest moon
Niggas better pull it soon or else suffer hellafied bullet wounds
And even though I stay clubbed with some thugs, why call 'em stug
When it comes to her love, it's none above she drawin blood
Static under the bra 'cause every time I take a hit at the bud
And give you a hug you gon' pop up a slug
Drinkin' remy on the block, gotta bust the glock
When the henny hit the chest, bustin' smith-n-wess
Fuck the discussion, I'm bustin' 'em all, clutchin' my balls
If I see y'all be laid to rest, let me hit the sess
Loose revolver used to be a problem solver
But the nina made me a baller
No strap could take the place of the black nine
Leave 'em flat lines, feelin' fury, you was born to taste
From my warm embrace

I got plenty love for the 4-4, 4-4, 4-4
Warm embrace
I got plenty love for the 4-5 (4-5), 4-5 (4-5), 4-5
Warm embrace
I got plenty love for the nine-mill (Nine-mill), nine-mill"

We'd like to welcome you all again to the world of vibrations
Introduction to the nation of revolutionary thoughts
Hear the sound evolve, expand, and change
Most of the things that we're sayin' haven't broken through your chatter
So y'all niggaz still ego trip based and
Have not begun to taste the kundalini wisdom bliss
I'm droppin' as a lyric quotin' vessel for the stages
Play this on your play list
I like dough
But musically I'm transcendin' the physical
And don't blame me for the slang and the words
God writes these rhymes through me
I just listen to him
I'm just livin' duke
Matrix driven rules haven't fooled me
'Cause I still think abstract
And stay metaphysical
And challenge what is really real
And keep creatin' with the force to bring rap back
Not that it's away
But everybody got somethin' to say
So let me speak the opposite of what's hot now
And make that hot
So it will get exploited
And the corporation only will back dudes who bite my style
And they can try and try again
I've been influenced by a lot of pioneers
South to the East and West
But when a hot MC
Gets on stage with a real MC
Most of the time the situation gets hostile

(Chorus: Ledisi)
We vibrate at higher frequencies
Welcome to our world and intro to
Fall into a space
Where there is no thoughts
Just moments captured
Here we go

We vibrate at higher frequencies
Let us up inside your head
Just step inside our world of vibration
Bump this from your birth to your deathbed

(Gift of Gab)
Take time with the pad and the pen to dig within
In a world of BS that we're livin' in
To my ears music sound sweet as cinnamon
So I stay poundin' out tunes and tunes again and again
In the 5th chapter ladies and gentlemen
And I still got MCs on my dinner menu
Write late at night this isn't David Letterman though
On second thought, I'm like a letter man though
Let the craft evolve catch a little syndrome
Shootin' through your vains, vibratin' though your eardrums
Used to think 30 years old then the end comes
Now I feel like I'm just gainin' momentum
Seen the world two times all except for India
About to vacate there when we finish this one
Work hard but still some sweep
We won't mention them
In fact, they act as fuel for our engine
Engine engine number 9, mic lynchin'
When we're done with this these songs are our pension
MCs are puppets, Me, I'm Jim Henson
Take a squat or get chopped by the henchmen
City, town, state arena or convention
Please believe these the G's that ease pension
Rakka and Ev said that it's a marathon
Song after song, we keep on inventin'

I'm darting around on a path of Brownian mystery.
I can't tell what's the ground or what's the sky or what's in between!

I've been away for so long that I've ended up right back home,
Amongst the family galaxy of nothing that stays the same.
I'm in the family galaxy and we only have one rule:
Keep changing every day, don't stay the same or you'll be a fool!
The family galaxy keeps changing no matter what you do.
We don't know who we are, but we will always be here for you!

Go nowhere, watch the world unfolding day by day,
Each time in a different way.
We'll swim in the sea of change-
Rearrange!
We don't mind where the question leads us.
We know nowhere is better than everywhere.
We have only one answer:
We don't care.
Family galaxy's always there for you and me,

Come and play in the suns,
They're all ours.
Family galaxy wants you to come and play, and change every day

One single voice don't matter
But everybody screamin up the ladder
Gonna get the attention of the man on top
Make his ladder shake and rock
And it might just
Come a' tumblin down
Spread all that wealth around
That's what I'm talkin' about

Hey-yeah this is my life
Woa-woa this is my life
Hey-yeah this is my life

Que critican lo actual

Hay hombres en la ciudad

Un señor muy gordo un día me preguntó
Si no me daba vergüenza estar así vestido
Yo le respondí que hiciera callar
Todos los gusanos de su panza."

Messier than canvas's by Jackson Pollock
Throwing multicolored thoughts at a rapid pace
I make a mess you dissect it and make sense of it
Then get back to me at your earliest convenience
Check my verbal sequence as I texturize these tracks
Seven layers to be exact eliminate the whack
With a firm brush stroke I MC paintily
Lyricists begin crumbling from my stumbling technique
As I tweak your audio and visual keep my drips minimal messages subliminal
Cause me and rap go way back we compliment
So together we enhance one another that's common sense
High intensity catches the eye your jaw drops
Be a real critic not explicit with false props
I keep my darks deep my lights bright I'm very thorough
With my chiaroscuro inspiration spark and a knife
Now watch me rock the spot like ? minus the heroin
And make my face popular like Andy did to Marilyn
Its kinda scary when real art gets left behind
While they take bullshit and start sellin' it to blind folks
But I remain humble as long as ? continues spinnin' hot shit
On his twin twelve-hundred color wheels of steel
Fuck mass appeal art is art only the real can truly feel it
So open your eyes and listen
Combine your ears with vision
Or do it cause you love it
Or for cash that's your decision
That's your decision
That's your decision

It's like I'm torn between two worlds
A paintbrush and a microphone
A canvas or a beat
CD or LP
Anything goes when my ink pen flows
And God only knows where it's gonna bring me next
So I'm inclined to like paint rhymes and spit kaleidoscopes with one eye closed
And I suppose if you chose the path that I chose
You know the cycle ass ho don't front
It goes inspiration and productivity then a sense of self worth and in steps depression
Like back and forth and forth and back
Should I paint a picture or record a track
A gift or a curse I don't know I'm still undecided
But over the years I've found clever ways to hide it
And those that lack the passion I have may despise it
But my momma made me this way I thank her everyday
So tell them kids to keep coloring outside the lines
Until they lose they limitations and they minds is free
Tell them teachers that you want your money back this time
And tell Bob Ross thanks for all the happy little trees
And tell my momma that her baby boy is doing just fine
Although hes running out of patience but his mind is free
And tell my pops that I'll pay his money back sometime
And that his son is two steps away from where he needs to be"

You was only hiding, like the lord above
Looking down like an angel, upon my lonely life
And no matter the angle, I want you to be my wife

I was dreaming, you understood
You were thinking, you wished you would
Looking down form your high horse
Like I didn't matter, of course

What they say at the funeral, it darkens and remorse
You were thinking I was sleeping in my thoughts
So lonely my tears fall down my brain
Rode my train for a cheap price, baby it's no surprise

Looking down from your high horse
Listening to my lullaby
I was thinking, that the world of sin
A sinking feeling, like I'm falling in love again

Looking down from your high horses

Say hello at my funeral

Hey yo, this song is for anyone... fuck it, just shut up and listen
Hey yo

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences gettin' this stress
That's been eatin' me recently off of this chest

And I rest again peacefully (peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter

To not come and speak to me (speak to me)
I don't know you and no, I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-ing thing

I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick

If you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet (10 feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you

Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of arguin' (of arguin)
I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be, it's just me

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content.
That song ""Guilty Conscience"" has gotten such rotten responses.""

And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinky

Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school

And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see an upper class city

Havin' this happenin' (this happenin' )
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name Is""

And pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
That copped me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)
To deal with these cocky caucasians

Who think, I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?

The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
Till I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (ahhh)
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (me crazy)
I can't take it, I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin' by it

You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

And you will forgive her
Lay me down beside the water
I look across at the sons and daughters

Sun comes up each day to chase away the moon
Even the stars at night they fade away too soon
You can't do much about the trouble life brings
Cut all the lines so the phones don't ring
But stay here once from spring to spring
Watching the ice melt the mornings sing

Oh my my the Mystic River
She takes your heart
And you will forgive her
Lay me down beside the water
I miss my sons I miss my daughter now

There's a tree that grows out in the burning sands
Never a drop of rain that nobody understands
You can push me I don't mind
Leave me out here and I'll be fine
Cause everyone's gonna have their time
Up or down honey you decide

Oh my my the Mystic River
She takes your heart
And you will forgive her
Lay me down beside the water
I miss my sons I miss my daughter now"

And there was Jesus on the radio
Jesus on the train...
Jesus in the calico

And there was love love love love
Anyone could see that there was love
Love all over me

Ah the second summer of love is here so tell your angry friends
To throw away their Gaultier and grow their hair again.

Acid on the rain...
Acid in the calico
Acid in the rain.

And there was love love love love
Anyone could see that there was love
Love all over me

There was love love love love love...
Anyone could see that there was love
Love all over me.

There was love all over the country
And there was love all over the world.

Acid on the radio, acid on the brain, acid everywhere you go,
Acid in the rain.

And there was love love love love, anyone could see that there was love
Love all over me.

Raising strong and mighty fortresses that I alone command
But these castles I've constructed by the strength of my own hand
Are just temporary kingdoms on foundations made of sand

In the middle of the battle I believe I've finally found
I'll never know the thrill of victory till I'm willing to lay down
All my weapons of defense and earthly strategies of war
So I'm laying down my arms and running helplessly to Yours

I surrender all my silent hopes and dreams
Though the price to follow costs me everything
I surrender all my human soul desires
If sacrifice requires
That all my kingdoms fall
I surrender all

If the source of my ambition is the treasure I obtain
If I measure my successes on a scale of earthly gain
If the focus of my vision is the status I attain
My accomplishments are worthless and my efforts are in vain

So I lay aside these trophies to pursue a higher crown
And should You choose somehow to use the life I willingly lay
Down
I surrender all the triumph for it's only by Your grace
I relinquish all the glory, I surrender all the praise

Everything I am, all I've done, and all I've known
Now belongs to You, the life I live is not my own
Just as Abraham laid Isaac on the sacrificial fire
If all I have is all that You desire
I surrender all"

How long ago he once had flown

When I was young he did relate
I'd watch the birds as they'd escape
From the greedy ground we grovelled on
Into the clouds and then beyond...

What kind of bird am I?
How can I learn to fly?

And so each day I'd try, he said
To let go of my mind of led
And with my body floating free
Swim in the air as in the sea

This was my greatest, strongest wish
And so the air did not resist
One day above the ground I rose
And felt the air beneath my toes

What kind of boy am I?
How can I learn to fly?

I rose above the tallest trees
And summersalted in the breeze
I dove with lightning speed and then
I shot up to the clouds again

I jumped off buildings with delight
And laughed at those afraid of heights
What need has anyone for fear
When we are free and the sky is near?

Oh, what a boy was I?
When do we learn to die?

And when I saw I was alone
And no one close to me would come
I soon forgot the joy of sky
And gently back to earth came I

I've never flown again, said he
Because we're all alike, you see
Our sickness strengthens unity
And no one needs to question me

And tell your brothers I'm in town

And tell my parents that I'm dead
And hope to hell I'm never found

Hoy hagamos la excepción de estirar la cuerda

Comme un saligaud
Mon copain le chêne
Mon alter ego
On était du même bois
Un peu rustique un peu brute
Dont on fait n'importe quoi
Sauf naturell'ment les flûtes
J'ai maint'nant des frênes
Des arbres de judée
Tous de bonne graine
De haute futaie
Mais toi tu manques à l'appel
Ma vieille branche de campagne
Mon seul arbre de Noël
Mon mât de cocagne.

Auprès de mon arbre,
Je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais dû m'éloigner d'mon arbre
Auprès de mon arbre,
Je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais dû le quitter des yeux.

Je suis un pauvre type
J'aurai plus de joie
J'ai jeté ma pipe
Ma vieille pipe en bois
Qui avait fumé sans s'fâcher
Sans jamais m'brûler la lippe
L'tabac d'la vache enragée
Dans sa bonne vieille tête de pipe
J'ai des pipes d'écume
Ornées de fleurons
De ces pipes qu'on fume
En levant le front
Mais j'retrouv'rai plus ma foi
Dans mon cœur ni sur ma lippe
Le goût d'ma vieille pipe en bois
Sacré nom d'une pipe.

Auprès de mon arbre,
Je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais dû m'éloigner d'mon arbre
Auprès de mon arbre,
Je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais dû le quitter des yeux.

Le surnom d'infâme
Me va comme un gant
D'avecque ma femme
J'ai foutu le camp
Parce que depuis tant d'années
C'était pas une sinécure
De lui voir tout l'temps le nez
Au milieu de la figure
Je bas la campagne
Pour dénicher la
Nouvelle compagne
Valant celle-là
Qui, bien sûr, laissait beaucoup
Trop de pierres dans les lentilles
Mais se pendait à mon cou
Quand j'perdais mes billes.

Auprès de mon arbre,
Je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais dû m'éloigner d'mon arbre
Auprès de mon arbre,
Je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais dû le quitter des yeux.

J'avais une mansarde
Pour tout logement
Avec des lézardes
Sur le firmament
Je l'savais par cœur depuis
Et pour un baiser la course
J'emmenais mes belles de nuits
Faire un tour sur la grande ourse
J'habite plus d'mansarde
Il peut désormais
Tomber des hallebardes
Je m'en bats l'œil mais,
Mais si quelqu'un monte aux cieux
Moins que moi j'y paie des prunes
Y'a cent sept ans, qui dit mieux,
Qu'j'ai pas vu la lune!

Auprès de mon arbre,
Je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais dû m'éloigner d'mon arbre
Auprès de mon arbre,
Je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais dû le quitter des yeux."

Can you feel the ground move 'round your feet

The crossroad above is where we meet
I shout out for shelter, I need you for something
The whole world is out, they're all on the street
Control yourself, love is all you need
Control yourself, in your eyes
Sanctify yourself, sanctify
Be apart of me, sanctify
Sanctify yourself, sanctify
Sanctify yourself, set yourself free

In pictures of living, in bloodshot a vision
Sweet miracles and strange circumstances
I see the sun up, the showdown, the cool winds that blow down
On the big beat that life-long romance is
You've got a gun in your hand, you're making self plans
Stay with me all through the night
Control yourself, love is all you need
Control yourself, open up your heart
Sanctify yourself, sanctify
Be apart of me, sanctify
Sanctify yourself, sanctify
Sanctify yourself, set yourself free

You can't stop the world for a boy or a girl
Sweet victims of poor circumstances
But you can pour back the love, sweeping down from above
Giving hope and making more chances
Well, I hope and I pray that maybe someday
You'll come back down here and show me the way
Control yourself, love is all you need
Control yourself, open up your heart
Open up your heart

And you feel like shining
And you feel like letting loose

And you better plan
Better plan all day

Better plan all week, better plan all month
Better plan all year

You're dressed up like a clown
Putting on your act
It's the only time all year
You'll ever admit that

I can see your eyes, I can see your brain
Baby, nothing's changed
I can see your eyes, I can see your brain
Baby, nothing's changed

Because you're hiding in a mask
You take your fun seriously
No, don't blow this year's chance
Tomorrow your mold goes back on

After Halloween 
After Halloween

You go to work today
You'll go to work tomorrow
Shitfaced tonight
You'll brag about it for months

Remember what I did, remember what I was
Back on Halloween?

But what's in between?
Where are your ideas?
You sit around and dream
For next Halloween

Why not every day, are you so afraid
What will people say?
Why not every day, are you so afraid
What will people say?

After Halloween
After Halloween
After Halloween

Because your role is planned for you
There's nothing you can do
But stop and think it through

But what will the boss say to you?
And what will your girlfriend say to you?
And the people out on the street, they might glare at you
And what do you know, you're pretty self-conscious too 

So you run back and stuff yourselves in rigid business costumes
Only at night to score is your leather uniform exhumed
Why don't you take your social regulations and shove 'em up your ass?
Why don't you take your social regulations and shove 'em up your ass?

Now I can't stand your guts, I'm like ""who is you?""
Boo you're through, I found another shooby-doo
You got my name all in that drama talkin' whoopty woop
How you just holla cause a nigga down with Snoopy group (Dogg Pound!)
Well me, I'm only down with you 'cause what your coochie do
Hoochie bitch, flossin' in a groupie suit
You was attracted to the mackin' and the Coupe was cute
I jumped out, hair braided, jean suits and boots
Chronic weed, Hennessy, my fo'-five and some loot
With my best girl, lookin' like - damn, you belong to a baller ""yes"" girl
Don't believe what she holler
Bitch 'bout a block past stupid with her raggedy ass
Runnin' up on Bad in that fashion
When you see me with my woman, we got somethin' in the oven -
CHA-PLOW! for your big mouth runnin'

(Chorus: Kokane)
If you see me walkin' with my bitch - (don't say shit!)
Keep it on the low-low (keep it on the low-low)
Just keep it on the low-low (keep it on the low-low)
If you see me walkin' with my bitch and my kids
Keep it on the low-low (just keep it on the low-low)
You silly little, you silly little hoe-hoe, hoe-hoe

(RBX)
SURPRISE! - the big homie X
Now matter what they stressin', I'm always connected
Can you say Dogghouse affiliated?
Now we's about to blast in with the hot chrome plated
Since I'm the big homie, I'ma aim the gun
And let you pull the trigger little Bad Azz nigga
Set it off - them niggaz talkin', get it off
And money ain't a thang like J, bet it all for cash
We 'bout to smash, pit bull mood
Bitch what you want - dick, dope, or dogg food?
All in my business, you best get your own
You a guest, get blasted in the danger zone - ooh
Long overdue, for dippin' in my mix, then this love's for you
Six feet deep, you get a customized ditch
Act like you don't know me when you see me with my bitch, bitch!

(Intro: Kokane)
If you see me walkin' with my bitch - (don't say shit!)
You better keep it on the low-low (keep it on the low-low)
You silly little hoe-hoe, you silly little hoe-hoe
If you see me walkin' with my bitch and my kids
Keep it on the low-low (just keep it on the low-low)
You silly little, you silly little hoe-hoe, hoe-hoe...

(Bad Azz)
Shut yo' motherfuckin' mouth
Here you walk about talkin' loud
This a situation you don't really know about
Shhh, shut yo' motherfuckin' mouth
When you see me with my woman and we out and about
Keep it on the low you - silly little hoe, you -
Mind your business, I act like I don't know you

(Outro: Bad Azz talking)
Bitch, don't be runnin' up on me in traffic
Like me and you got some type of business together
For real bitch, rewind the son"

Crushed by one stroke of the hand of death

Smear my face with the ash of dying

World beyond the grave
Destroying the disease that infests the

Hail storm of blistering stones
And I hear the serpent's whisper
To leave the heavens in flames
Upon black stallions
We trample your crown of thorns
With furious fires of vengeance
Your throne has ling since crumbled
And the flames of the new lords rise
Within the shadows of
Satan
And the angels shall be my whores
Shrouded beneath blackened veils
Arise in flames

Uplifting a sensation of unconcern to set ablaze the northern divine
Atheist on the forefront of conception
Parche d theory to preserve the death of felicity
Warmth of arctic apathy fills the glutton fat
Absorb this seething expiration
Melting with the obvious defeat of the city of

Strong with the desire of hate
As reality and vision united
Communion enlarge my darkness
With multitude of light
The still uncolored circle of seven senses
The visionary wheel of drifting desired shadows

Affections of remained rites
Filled by perfumes of past destination
A distant chaos far beyond
From what our eyes can see
The superhuman side within
A mixed movement of a demolished world

Unlocked narration of key elements
Creates the wall of past and future passing
Let's all wounds be now against our bodies
Release fantasy before the eyes
Runs sudden to the depth of subconscious

Decentness sun of night releases my fate
Half wayside of life and emptiness
Upland in distant night of galaxies
Glass awake the symbol of passage
Reflection demands the quest of existence

Kept upon illusions of fancy gateway
The sound of silence pours my body
Underground pyramid of blood
Creations and destructions of century bone"

A dreamlover will come my way
Someone to hold in my arms
Feel the magic of their charms

'Cause I want someone to call my own
I want a dreamlover so I don't have to dream alone

Dreamlover where are you
With a love, a love so true
And a hand I can hold
Be with you as I grow old

Someday I don't know how
I hope you'll hear my plea
Someway I don't know how
You'll give your love to me

Dreamlover, until then
I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
Till all my dreams come true

I want a... dreamlover... so I don't have to dream... alone"
6761,TRANQLL128F92F5263.h5,Shakira,Poem To A Horse,"You're too far to bring you close 
And too high to see below 
Just hangin' on your daily dose 

I know you never needed anyone 
But the rolling papers for your grass 
How can you give what you don't have 

You keep on aiming for the top 
And quit before you sweat a drop 
Feed your empty brain 
With your hydroponic pot 
Start out playing with yourself 
You get more fun within your shell 
Nice to meet you but I gotta go my way 

I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain 
But you're so in love with yourself 
If I say my heart is sore 
Sounds like a cheap metaphor 
So I won't repeat it no more 

I rather eat my soup with a fork 
Or drive a cab in New York 
'Cause to talk to you is harder work 

So what's the point of wasting all my words 
If it's just the same or even worse 
Than reading poems to a horse 

You keep on aiming for the top 
And quit before you sweat a drop 
Feed your empty brain 
With your hydroponic pot 
I bet you'll find someone like you 
'Cause there's a foot for every shoe 
And I wish you luck but I've other things to do 

I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain 
But you're so in love with yourself 
If I say my heart is sore 
Sounds like a cheap metaphor 
So I won't repeat it no more 

I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain 

If I say my heart is sore 
Sounds like a cheap metaphor 

I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain 
But you're so in love with yourself 
If I say my heart is sore 
Sounds like a cheap metaphor 
So I won't repeat it no more"

I'm just a little bit depressed
I tried to blame it on the rain 
But it was in my heart I guess
I'm feeling like a stranger 
When I drove through my hometown
Passed the sign that reads 'The Boyhood Home of a Place That's Long Gone Now'

I realized ain't nothing what it used to be
Until I heard a song that takes me to my memories

The radio saved my life tonight
Old song that that DJ played made me feel alright
Made it home by my dashboard light
The radio saved my life tonight

Just this side of morning 
Just this side of dawn
I walked so soft into my bedroom 
Saw my wife sleeping alone
She whispered, ""Baby, are you OK? Have you been gone for long?""
I just kicked off my jeans and I held her close 
I held her all night long

I tried to sleep but in my mind I heard that song
Like a friend in need the melody keeps me hanging on

The radio saved my life tonight
Old song that that DJ played made me feel alright
Made it home by my dashboard light
The radio saved my life tonight

The radio saved my life tonight
The sad song that the DJ played made me feel alright
As I drove down that lonesome highway just me and my dashboard light
The radio saved my life tonight

Old song that that DJ played made me feel alright
I made it home by my dashboard light

You've got so many friends
You bet they stand by you
Course you've got some faith

Constitute your backbone

Base life on solid ground
Trust in your future
By just a simple count

You thought you're footloose
And fancy free
Enjoy your freedom
Nothing lasts forever
You should have known
Just dreams stick for a lifetime

Envy and jealousy
Rips your destiny
Who you believe a word
And... of life
'Cause you've no idead
How mean this world could be

As long as you're respected
People kissing your feet
But faster that you expected
They'll make you bleed
Trapped in reality
They'll lead you from your destiny
Trapped in a tragedy
Trapped in reality
They'll lead you from your destiny
Trapped in a tragedy

Cut them with your knife
Everything will fade away
They melt into the void

The unions... you made
You have done your job
They will throw you away
They'll go to their decline"

Now I'm wiping off my grin
A widow's spider's web I'm in
There's none so blind as he who sees
With hindsight
Twenty twenty

You think you know it all
But there's always something more

You're exactly what I needed
But how was I to know
Now that I've discovered it
I have to let it go
Exactly what I needed
So tell me what was wrong
Something so intangible
You never really miss it till its
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone

This bed of roses that I'm in
Turns out as only thorns and stems
I used to recognize this place
For what it's worth
But not today
It wasn't all that long ago
When I was perfect on my own
I used to thrive on my mistakes
Few as they were
But that has changed

Everything I knew
An illusion to me know

I used to wake up everyday
I used to go my perfect way
I used to dream of my mistakes
Few as they were

A season that lasts through all changes in time
I try so hard sometimes
I wish there was a raincheck on tomorrow
Not ready to deal with what I don't wanna find

Struggling on, just to hold on
I just wanna know, why is it me?

In a tear there is a message from the heart
Detached from the good, it's the hope gone astray
I cry so hard sometimes
Too scared to think of what will bring tomorrow
Already much more than I can handle today

I can't breathe, suffocate as I'm buried by hate
And so sadly I learn, there's no justice to fate
I just wanna know why is it me?
Losing the race with thoughts out of place
I just wanna, know why is it me?

You ain't got a monopoly on sorrow
You know plenty has made it my way
You ain't got a monopoly on sorrow
There's plenty that feel just the same

There's a pain so insane that I fight but can't tame
And my mind battles on as my body lies lame

I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts
I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts
I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts
I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts
Hurts, hurts

It just would stay clear then I'd see and I'd go

Into something that
Used to be a game

The fragments of faith
I can still recall
When I feel that
I'm present, I just know
If there's anything
I should regret
I would've been told
Counting hours
Counting days
Will you listen
Will you play
Is there anyone
Who can get it done?
Taking me back to the place
That I once belonged
What if tomorrow
Was gently taken
Away from me
Away from me

Awaking the memories
Was I meant to get old
Repressing the agonies
Start breaking the mold

And the faith
Comes back to life
Still waiting for
A constant thing to react
But I will save myself 
Some of the time
Keep aiming for
A constant thing to react

As the sleeper awakes

Mesmerized by the memories
That walk by my side
Shelter comes easy
As soon as sadness sets in
By an impulse the search will begin

Searching, collecting
All the things
I possess a detecting
The insight I've
Earned in distress
Learning, finally I know
How to breathe
Turning, turning away
From the greed
So unpleasant
It strikes whenever I call
So relentless
As I fall
A grand awakening
Will kill it all
Nevertheless
I'll be my own precious god
I can't resist
The things I've missed
And I'll make sure that it
Will last the time
I will insist
What if tomorrow
Was taken away from me
Away from me
Away from me

Awaking the memories

Once upon a time but not long ago when there was no rapstars on TV-shows,
No movie deals, commercials, russ and his cruss just startin to grow
In them days when you cup the art, you did a sake for the money and adverse for the heart

Back then you had to be a true believer
Every, all hung at the disco fever
DJ Flash in Hollywood
Made it happen in the streets of Manhatten

Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island sound
People came from miles around see us get down
This song's dedicated to the fact that you gotta recognise by nears an' raps

Lalala) Yeah just do it, do it, do it
(Lalalala lalala) All right, darling, come on!

A one way magic dream
The starlight come between us
In her fall trim green menagerie

With flowers in her hair

herido de amor, herido por vos,
herido se parte este pobre corazón,
herido me encelo si yo no te veo,
herido me muero si yo no te tengo,
herido a morir, herido por ti,
herido consumo mi forma de vivir,
ay de vivir...

Dime si me quieres o si no,
déjame tranquilo te lo pido por favor
porque yo no puedo seguir así
volviéndome loco.

eras la punta de un gran iceberg
que no tardó en congelar
y destruir lo mejor que había en mí,
a veces me preguntaba...

herido me encelo si yo no te veo,
herido me muero si yo no te tengo,
herido a morir, herido por ti,
herido consumo mi forma de vivir,
ay de vivir...

Dime si me quieres o si no,
déjame tranquilo te lo pido por favor
porque yo no puedo seguir así volviéndome loco,
completamente loco por quererte así,
que como yo te quiero nadie a ti te querrá,
mi hermano me decía que no te iba a necesitar,
te echo tanto de menos pero mucho de menos.

Oye kiya, tú sabes que tu corazoncito que va conmigo,
creo que tú sabes que sí, que no,
que bueno, vale, pero tú sabes muy bien,
que dijo mi mare un día, que contigo moriría, que contigo mataría
porque sabe que te quiero, dícelo
pero kiyo, pero chiquilla que yo te quiero, no lo ves?

When I was only nine or ten
I’d run trot lines in the muddy water
I’d watch the leaves riding the wind

It was there I smoked my first Marlboro
It was there I kissed Laurie Jones
I’d lie in the tall grass for hours
I’d walk in the shallows, I’d skim those stones

And one day I was climbing in the railroad trestle
I heard the sound of a coming train
Man it was on me like a rolling thunder
Lit a fear inside I can’t explain

Sent me running, sent me screaming
Like a wild man through the tall grass
Trying to make it back home

And it was then I ran into that stranger
With his suitcase and his walking cane
He put his hand on my little shoulder
And since that day I ain’t been the same

He sends me running, sends me screaming
Down a freeway, down a runway
Trying to make it back home

And here I stand in this darkened hallway
My babies sleeping, dreaming soft and low
I feel his hand on my shoulder
Like that day down down by the Mill Creek long ago"

No questions
I pledge resistance to the grass
That hides the snakes of America
So they watch it, now I walk with caution
More careful put more thought to options
Is the opposite of progress Congress?
From the school to the street we're beyond stress
But I fight for peace, that's what the problem is
War is big biz, ask an economist
Speak in volumes callin' anti-war and anti-American synonymous
Back in the day I would've gotten black listed just for speakin' up
Hoover probably would've screamed Communist!
I want black and brown unity
But cats get out to bring the jail to the community
Fightin's nothin' new to me
I even corrected what the public school system tried to do to me
Here's a spark encoded in rhyme and love for everyone of the devoted in line...
We call it art, some call it a crime
It's the rap Michael Moore, like Bowling for Columbine
On drums, Fahrenheit, 9-1-1
Al Queda hit the Apple and the world was stunned
The villain trained by the hero for the killing
Now you twist $20 bills to see buildings
Under heavy surveillance
They might call you a traitor if you want something greater
Don't get me wrong, America's a great place to live
Just listen to the knowledge I give
If more than half the budget goes to military spending
Less than half goes to whatever it's defending
One nation, many gods, individuals with liberties
And justice for all who are miserable

I lost my nerves when he took me on 
He was this high-healed smooth talking middleclass bastard 
Who tried to stab me for where I was from 
And though his words was covered in yesterdays mud 
The boys around him laugh his way 
But on the parking lot where I was born 
He didn't come to play 

No he didn't dare to stay

You think you're talking to Annie's angle 
You think you're down with the people who laugh when you frown 
And then move from ground to ground 

Such a pit no one's hurt from your punch 
Must be a drag to look so debased 
On the other side you've still got your kids to die for 
So why take it all out on me 
That angry look doesn't suite your face 
You've got your medals in a box 
And on the telly there's this leader saying 
' Blame it on the boss 

You've got to blame it on the boss

She's leaving home again
Maybe this time she'll be strong enough
Tears fill up her eyes
As her kids wave their goodbyes
Maybe this time they'll be strong enough
Finally its fare-thee-well
Thirty three, she's been through hell
It's time to ramble on
She takes off all her clothes
The petals stripped off of a rose
The pain is finally gone
And somewhere way up in the night
The moon reflects a brilliant light
And she smiles because she knows that she is free


A lonely man shaving in the sink
As he slowly sips his drink
He remembers how he used to be
The numbness in his soul runs deep
Blacker and blacker, week by week
He remembers how things used to be
His kids are grown, his wife's long gone
He stumbles home then drinks till dawn
He won't escape today
He drops his shoes onto the floor
Can't fight these demons anymore
He finally falls asleep
And somewhere way up in the night
The moon reflects a brilliant light
And he cries because he knows he can't be free"

Snuck up behind me and jumped on my shopping cart
And rolled down aisle five
You looked behind you to smile back at me
Crashed into a rack full of magazines
They asked us if we could leave

Can't remember what went wrong last September
Though I'm sure you'd remind me if you had to

Our love was comfortable and so broken in

I sleep with this new girl I'm still getting used to
My friends all approve, say ""she's gonna be good for you""
They throw me high fives
She says the Bible is all that she reads
And prefers that I not use profanity
Your mouth was so dirty

Life of the party and she swears that she's artsy
But you could distinguish Miles from Coltrane

Our love was comfortable and so broken in
She's perfect
So flawless
Or so they say, hey
Say, hey

She thinks I can't see the smile that she's faking
And poses for pictures that aren't being taken
I loved you
Grey sweatpants
No makeup
So perfect

Our love was comfortable and so broken in
She's perfect
So flawless

Hauling the Kraken up with blocks and chains -

Only one thing makes it when the Devil drives:

We're gonna steel up the flesh to the fire
You gonna find out what the rules are then
Well sister, sister, won't you pray for me -
We're going running on the rocks again...

Flaming amazement - madder than the gale
Wreathed in shadows; crackling in the sails
This is our mission now as then -
We can do no other here we stand: Amen
The winds are crying - remember me
Through the holy silence of the desert and the sea
The next Armada waiting for the tide
Wind and rain are nothing to the storm inside

We're gonna steel up the flesh to the fire
You gonna find out what the rules are then
Well sister, sister, won't you pray for me -

First you rock the hip and then you rock the hop
Then you hippie the hop and don't stop
Going on and on and on and on
Like hot butter on say what the popcorn
Gonna rock the beat to the break of dawn
Gonna party, party, party till you're all going home

This is the way we used to rhyme
These are the rhymes that we used to say
This is the way we used to sound
Way, way back in the day

Clap your hands and stomp your feet
And rock to the rhythm of the funky beat
Stomp your feet and clap your hands
'Cause I am the man with the master plan
Going back and forth and forth and back
Three words for the wack's: stay the hell back
If the wack may attack keep the wack back
This drum machine is guaranteed to cause a heart attack
Going up to the ceiling, down to the floor
Bounce around the balls and back out the door
Tried to come back in cause you want more
Those funky rhymes galore

This is the way we used to rhyme
These are the rhymes that we used to say
This is the way we used to sound

Pepper to the salt, salt to the pepper
Don't come to the party if you're a half-stepper
Salt to the pepper, pepper to the salt
If you can't rock to this it ain't my fault
A lime to a lemon, a lemon to a lime
I rock the rhyme in half the time

Like 4-5-6 on Cee-lo Dice
And I get more sex than a cat chase mice
Rock and roll, and roll and rock
Let's rock to the rhythm of the rock, rock, rock
And roll and rhyme, and rock and roll
Come on, party people, let's get out of control
Now the people in the back and not the wack
To the people on the side, let's ride
To the people in the middle let me see you wiggle
And people on the top, don't stop
Jump up, jump up
Just like a disco duck
Go down, go down
Just like a disco clown
Go on, go on
To, to the break of dawn
Jump back, jump back
And I can rock it like this 'cause I got it like that
Now do it, do it, do, do, do it
Do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do, do, do it
Do, do it, do it
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if y'all wanna rock the house tonight
Somebody say ""oh yeah"" (oh yeah)

Something I cannot avoid

So when you come around

Searching for a piece that I never found

I feel so stupid, friends knew it, turned to it

I'm by myself, I'm bound to be

I can't find what I'm missing
I've lost myself I hope that you're listening
I've seen my puzzle taken apart
It's hard to start again

But with you, all I knew was the filth that you put me through

I'm sick reliving the past
My time it came and it passed
I'm holding on to the memories, making them last
So when you come around
You'll find me on the ground
Searching for a piece that I never found

And I knew it was to be

Filled my heart with broken glass

Till it's the cruellest shape in the world

In the sand and I hope and pray

And there's a song I wrote for those who would like to sing
But I still play alone on these old heartstrings
'Cause how we tried and tried to make that perfect harmony
Wasn't it a shame, we never heard the same?
That's why in these times I
Write about forgiveness in the sand
And I hope and pray that it's here to stay

So when those birds fly south in the winter I have to go
Baby please don't cry it's the end of our long goodbye

Hidden like a four-leaf clover 
Are you miles away 
Are we getting any closer 
Are we getting any closer

Is a like a scene from a dream in heaven 
I feel you running through 
All my senses 
Will you taste like rain 
Can I breathe you like air 
Will I lose myself in your arms somewhere

Over and under 
I can really see us having babies 
Walking through the park and being lazy

And I know and I know and I know 
Love can move a mountain 
And I know and I know 
It's gonna be even better than I imagined 
Putting all my trust in you 
Putting all my trust in you 
We'll make this dream come true

How I'm feelin' and
When you hear
This news you might
Fly through the ceiling
But I'm willing to
Let you know the truth and
In fact it's better that I told you
For you hear the story back
It's bout this new girl
I'm creeping
It's my little secret and
I can hardly keep it

Yo peep it

It's yo sista
Yeah homie I been wit her
I been wit her for a while now
There's nothin' you can do about it

(This is stressin me out)

It's yo sista
Yeah homie I been wit her
I been wit her for a while now
There's nothin' you can do about it

The first time I ever seen her
Y'all moved around my way
I was dyin' to met her
But I met you first and we became real cool
Started hangin' out at school
Now why you reachin' for your tool
Ain't no need for no beef so stop actin' the irrational
Still that same brother who always had your back for you
You know I would never hurt you or try to be foul
Besides you don't want your niece growin' up without her daddy around
That's right your babby sisters quite pregnant
And we've already checked into meetin with da reverand

It's yo sista
Yeah homie I been wit her
I been wit her for a while now
There's nothin' you can do about it

It's yo sista
Yeah homie I been with her
I been with her for awhile now ('cause I luv her)
There's nothin' you can do about it

It's yo sista
Yeah homie I been wit her
I been with her for awhile now
There's nothin' you can do about it

It's yo sista
Yeah homis I ben wit her
I been wit her for awhile now
There's nothin' you can do about it

(You're my best friend, please try to understand)

It's yo sista
You know I love her

Won't never leave her

Remember the day I never made it to hoop practice?
I wasn't really sick and laid up
I made up that whole story just so I could be with the girl
She makes my heart skip a beat
Lolli pops call her sweet
The twinkle in her eye and the dimples in her cheek
Everytime I see her smile I swear my knees get weak
I swear my knees get weak..."

I gotta let these motherfuckers know how to crawl man.

I know everybody tryin' to come up immediately.

Saafir:You know they don't got the motherfuckin' perseverance 'cause they
Ain't have it hold up though. I gotta go and do this man.

You can hear the ambition mobbin' in my po position
The intention is to come up
Do your grindin' pay the boss before you floss
And don't lose your mind and find discipline'
And stackin' your scratch
So it don't come up missin' in
As you're askin' the Lord for guidance
While you ridin'
Stickin' and movin' slidin'
In and out the game
Unless you realize you're sprung before you legalize your funds
All you track hustlers that was made for the corner
Dodgin' the coroner's office
I'm tossin' this at you
Now on some sermon type shit
I'm burnin' and I gotta write this
The mic got me ballin'
Shot callin'
It's the murk one like that
Sit back but not in starship
So I don't tarnish or rust
When I'm bustin' on the next jerk
Who swears he's ballin' but can't network
You better off with sexwork
The way you fucked in the game
It's a shame
I'm aimin' at the bathroom stall on all of y'all
With the H.J.s deflecting these hate rays
Until the sun falls
You acquired a dream
Crawl before you ball

What you thought?
You was just gonna ball on the spot?
Let's be real
You gotta stack dollar bills before you get a mil
Gotta handle business before you choose to chill or you fall
Crawl before you ball

All you pompous ass marks in Babylon yawnin'
Becomin' another nigga spawnin'
&gt;From the trenches
The stench is unknown
I've been crawlin' like a two toed
Chameleon for so long
Writing these songs and ridin' these thongs
With bracelets on they ankle bone
That's anxious to moan
Like Neena Samone
Have a trick
Sickin' thinkin'
That we know it's on
You better crawl before you ball man
Before you fall man
Keep ya hoes off your payroll
Unless they crawl with you
And you know they all with you
And even then they won't fall with you
I'm like fuck 'em
I got to
It's a new sheriff in town his name is Reggie Mamoo
Ya hear?
More like Saafir
On a crawl
By watch how daddy ball
I'm all ears and all eyes
Recognize
I'm crawlin'

Baby baby let me kick my all to y'all
You gotta crawl before you ball
I've seen so many many soldiers fall
They didn't know you had to crawl before you ball

You see gotta put in major work in at first
Before you burst
Crawl before you ball but never lose your thirst
When you ballin'
Or you gonna end up broke and butt naked with no garments on
While I'm makin' more cheese than Parmesian
Learn game at a fast rate
Apply it to my walk then stalk
I won't fall off 'cause I'm a put in that work
And I'm a stick to that plan
Now I'm a stay down with my folleys
The team then turn and brace God gave green
Going, going till I'm gone
I'm ballin'"

In a night so dark and silent as in the realms of death
Through the horizont they now come forth,
In the streams of nothing going toward eternity
From a world far beyond a world of evil existence they dwell
Within the light of God and await the final resurrection
Born by the rage of torment... fire
The spawn of evil shall defeat the...
Liar demons of the coming judgement
Where they may wonder blood shall follow their path
Driven by the vengeance from an earlier past
Storms of crimson rain is bound to fall,
Repent your sins cause today you die
Chained to life with a fate not knowned
The ones of evil habit shall bring you down"

But I've got it all figured out
I like to wake up in the morning
And when the truth was told
The'd say Tex never donated nothing
But then ole Tax never stole
I just like to start even, start even that's all

I like to wake up in the morning
And sy there's two things I never done
I ain't never fought with nobody
But then I ain't never run
I just like to start even, start even that's all

I'd like to wake up in the morning
Without a sweetheart or a wife
Or without some little gal hanging around
Saying Tex done ruined her life
Wish I'd never made nobody happy, made nobody sad
Got nobody tickled or made nobody mad
Then I could just start even, start even that's all
And then that's all

Now I never dabbled in high society
Don't reckon I would if I could
I'm a little too good for the bad folks
And a-way too bad for the good
If I don't soon lose my misery

One of these mornings I ain't gonna wake up at all

As cute as she can be
Moved in today
Across the way
At number sixty three
And she's made a hit with me

The cutest little hat
And all the boys just call her ""Baby""
She's got a dainty style
A little baby smile
The kind that makes you wanna stick around awhile

She's got those dreamy eyes
And every time she sighs
You forget your family
Her father's over eighty with his nice grey locks
He's made a million dollars out of bonds and stocks
And she's his only child
And she's just awfully wild
That's the kind of baby for me

She's got a dog and cat

And all the boys just call her ""Baby""
She's got a bungalow
Down where the breezes blow
And lots of other little things you shouldn't know

She's got those dreamy eyes
And every time she sighs

I raised a little moustache, cute as any pup
My baby kissed me once and burned the darned thing up
She said, ""It's so much fun
Please raise another one""

And when I saw the cheque I thought it was the rent
But when the waiter came
She simply signed her name

In my dark cup and forget this all

May your troubles all be small ones
And your fortunes ten times ten
May the good Lord bless and keep you

May you walk with sunlight shining
And a bluebird in every tree
May there be a silver lining
Back on every cloud you see.

Fill your dreams with sweet tomorrows
Never mind what might have been
May the good Lord bless and keep you
Till we meet again.

Se pierde el mal
Un nuevo día es tanto
Que hace bien y que salva
Te vi bailando sola
Entre exceso y discreción
Buscando historia, juntando años
Sobre mí se abre tu flor de humedad

En muchos de tus lugares
Con el amor no alcanza
Hasta un buen corazón
Puede perder la calma
Dame de lo que puedas
O se perderá para siempre
Todo lo que cayó ardió dos veces
Sobre mí se abre tu flor de humedad

Buenos Aires, ciudad del sino
Duende de un destino
Ante la luz de tus amores, de tu misterio divino
Hoy no sé, mañana tal vez, caiga rendido

El tiempo y el agua que tiene hoy este río
Aún no pudo apagar tanto fuego caído
Vicios de sociedad
Que está esperando un milagro
Algunos los que van, otros clavados al barro
Sobre mí se abre tu flor de humedad

Se van juntando almas
Símbolo de un sueño que nace
Tantos años de lucha
Por tus rincones y calles
Prisionero fugaz que está con vos y con otra
Boca roja de tango que me provoca
Sobre mí se abre tu flor de humedad

Buenos Aires, ciudad del sino
Duende de un destino
Ante la luz de tus amores, de tu misterio divino
Hoy no sé, mañana tal vez, caiga rendido"

Ich schieß dir auf die Füße, es läuft „Twist and Shout“
In diesen Club kannst du reinkommen, aber nicht mehr raus
Schreib dein Text in zehn Minuten, es wirkt eher wie fünf
Ich verbreite Scheiße über dich, ganz egal, ob es stimmt
Hauptsache, es stinkt, du bist kein Pimp
Nur weil sich deine Frau wie eine Nutte schminkt
Du bist meine neue An- und Ausziehpuppe
Kauf dir mal was Neues zum Ausziehen, Nutte
Baut bitte die Twin Towers wieder auf
Fürs Video reiße ich sie wieder aus
Sobald die U-Bahn-Tür zu ist, willst du jeden hier abstechen
Ich brauche kein Messer, du kriegst Seitenstiche beim Rappen
Es gibt nur die Nummer 1 in meinem Team:
Craft, Euro, Tarek, Maxim
Renn um dein Leben, K.I.Z. mit der Schreckschuss
Kommt mit der U-Bahn und geht mit dem Lexus

[Refrain:]
Du willst dein Kind schützen, also machst du das Radio aus
Doch es wird dir nichts nützen
Verriegel die Türen, amputier ihn die Ohren und vernagel dein Haus
Wir sind hier, um zu siegen
Mit dem Fuß in der Tür und dem Schwanz in der Hand!
Ihr passt perfekt in unser Feindbild und ab jetzt seid ihr Freiwild

Wir machen Scheiße zu Gold

[Nico:]
Ich rappe nicht, ich folge meinem Trieb
Kein Track – das ist der Vierminütige Krieg (KRIEEEG!)
Ihr ruht euch alle hinter der Bühne beim Catering aus
Ich stehe am Mic und schmeiße Holzfäller-Steaks in die Crowd
Das ist kein Schwanz, das ist ein Meilenstein
Deine Frau liegt an Silvester vor mir, ich feier rein
Egal, ob Rucksack oder Platinkette
Alle Crews hängen an unser’m Sack, als wär er eine Straßenecke
Langeweile? Reg dich über unser Logo auf
Was, „Ignoranz“? Ich bringe einen Rohling raus
K.I.Z. (K.I.Z.!) – es ist 2005
Rap bedeutet, dass du dir fürs Video ’nen Leihwagen nimmst
MCs haben keine Luft, ich leih ihn gern mein [?]
Lables sind wie kleine Kinder: Sie achten nicht auf die Straße
Wenn ihr Hip-Hops Arschloch auch schon gefickt seht
Geht in die Läden und kauft unser Mixtape

[Tarek:]
Deine Eltern hassen dich, siezen dich, wenn sie dich sehn
Das Einzige, was du mir beibringen kannst, ist Kochen und Nähen (NÄH’N!)
Fick eure Szene, ich schlag keine Kinder
Inzwischen rapp ich besser als alte Vorbilder
Ich bin ein Künstler, du mein Werk, wenn wir uns duellieren
Ich komm mit Kissen auf die Fete, um die Schüsse zu dämpfen
Denn ich bin hier, um die Tapete mit deinem Hirn zu verzieren
Würde er leben, wären wir die Lieblingsband von Charles Manson
Tarek, K.I.Z., gegen Grün allergisch
Du triffst mich und bemerkst, dass die Verfassung nichts mehr wert ist
Ich komm mit Kettensäge, wenn ich euch Bürschchen hole
Nach K.I.Z. sind blutige Metzgerschürzen Mode
Ich rappe, bis ihr einpackt und die Spitze für uns freimacht
Will ein’ Maybach, weil mein Ego in kein anderes Auto reinpasst
Mutterficker, mach dich bereit, denn das Frühjahr wird heiß
Nach „Böhse Enkelz“ stinkt das Land nach verbranntem Fleisch

Where my journey leads I do not know.
I just follow my inner voice.
Longer and longer on misty pathways I go.

I travel into an unknown vale.
Through forests over hills and far away.

The chilly breezes of night surrounds me
With their smooth gentle touches.
The fog hides the path
Which I walk upon.

Voices I hear from inside the dark
And dusky the night have laid.
Observed by the forgotten shadowpeople I am
As I wander through their realm.

The silvery cold moon looks upon me.
As I strive through these spellbound forests."

I draw first blood be the first to set it off
My cause, tap all jaws lay down laws
We takin' what's yours we do jerks rush the doors
Here come the deez tryin' to make breeze and guns toss
In full force, my team'll go at your main source
We're not tourists, hit bosses and take hostage
Your whole setup, from the ground up we lock shit
Blood flood your eye, fuck up your optics
Switch to killer instincts for niggaz pop shit
Yo nigga Noyd what's the topic? Nine pound we rocked in
Ninety-six strike back with more hot shit
Illuminate my team'll glow like, radiation
With no time for patient, or complication
Let's get it done right, my click airtight
Trapped in a never ending gunfight so niggaz lose stripes
Or lose life, jail niggaz sendin kites to the street
Over some beef that wasn't fully cooked, finish 'em off
Well done meat, that said twenty-two slug to your head
Travel all the way down to your leg

Chorus: together

Aiyyo it's hell on earth, whose next or gonna be first
The projects is front lines, and the enemy is one time
I ain't gotta tell you
It's right in front of your eyes

We wreck the QBC, nigga rep yours it's all love
Milli stacked down, heavenly guarded by hollow tip slug
Then crack down, on wannabe thugs adapt to gat sound
And bow down, slow the fuck up, see how my foul now
Articulate, hittin body parts to start shiftin shit
Never hesitant, it's the crack game unlimited
Summon rasta we can do this, forever infinite
Then reminesce, twenty years later how we was gettin' it
Either with me go against the grain you better hit me
Leggin me or robbin me niggaz better body me
'Cause it's a small world and niggaz, talkin' like bitches
Bitches singin' like snitches, pointin you out in pictures
'Cause she rep the QBC faithfully, playa hatin' me
All that bullshit, is just makin' me
More the better, then concentrate on gettin' chedda
If shorty set you up you better dead her, I told you
Shape and mold you, Sun you, then I hold you
Like a pimp mind control you double edge blow you
It'll be I, like I'm supposed to, the click is coastal
International to local, Bacardi mix physically fix
Hit you with shit, that'll leave a loose nigga stiff
Probably thick, Son I solved em
Pulled him in my world then evolved him to chaos
Walk the beat like, around the way cops the average pitstop
QBCity GodFather Part III, Gotti Gambino
And Ty Nitty, Scarface rest in peace

Yo, the heavy metal king hold big shit, with spare clips
You seein clips when the mac spit your top got split
Layin dead with open eyes close his eyelids
Turn off his lights switch to darkness, cause deep in the abyss
Is street life, blood on my kicks, shit on my knife
Youse the wild child, kid cold turnin' men into mice
I was born to take power leave my mark on this planet
The Phantom of Crime Rap, niggaz is left stranded
Shut down your operation, closed for business
Leave a foul taste in your mouth, like Guinness
POW niggaz is found MIA
We move like the special forces, green beret
Heavily around my throat, I don't play
Shit brand new, back in eighty-nine, the same way
The God P walk with a limp see, but simply
To simplify shit, no man can go against me
Test me you must be bent G, don't tempt me
I had this full clip for so long, it needs to empty
The reason why it full for so long, 'cause I don't waste shit
You probably hid, blood in your mouth, so you could taste it
Quiet as kept, I lay back and watch the world spin
I hear thugs, claimin that they gonna rob the Mobb
When they see us, I tell you what black, here's the issue
It's a package deal, you rob me, you take this message
Along with that, I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm tryin' to make CREAM and that's that
Whatever it takes however it gots to go down
Four mikes on stage a motherfuckin four pound
Speakers leakin out sound and niggaz leakin on the ground
I could truly care less the God will get his
Regardless blow for blow let's find out who wear hardest
This rap artist used to be a stickup artist
Sometimes I test myself see if I still got it
A live nigga stay on point never diss
Regard shit or forget the essence, from which I emerged
P is sick, so save that bullshit for the burbs
Live up to my word, if I got beef, niggaz comin' in herds

The future never known
A black hole of undivine nature for destruction of heresy
The stellar cycle about to be sucked into the imploding dark star to resurface an early cycle of man for a new millennium
Closure begins in collapse,
Dissolving into the raven giant
We are timeless... within damnation
Outer descent thrown into a reversal of extinction
No emotion within this promise of damnation
On sorelines of the perverse
The
Armageddon of prophecies unfold
This threshold of an event horizon
Collapses into a closure of negative density
Look past the stories of life
Look beyond these lies of a garden of delight
The serpents tale is only beginning of this interstellar rebirth
Hell's cold fire
Begin a cycle reborn
Devouring of utopia
Attain within non-escape
Haste to collide with this transi tional barrier that makes a dead man free
The cold ground is a warm death that leaves the personal idea of dying a lonesome rebirth
Grasp towards the sky from within this depression
As mountains of scattered head stones lay
A far worse burial stigma becoming the inquisition
The black heart of cold faith
Bare this cross a tranquil agnostic epitaph
The delivery of a condemned ideal
The veil closes its swollen eyes from above

Clinically dead and made it all that much easier to lie
But its nothing that I'm proud of (no its nothing that I'm proud of)
Making an example out of you
Well this is phase one

Coral and bone

Infinite city
No sexy sneer
Hideous creation
Human and animal

Banter songs of rudeness to be adhered
Not on rocks that glisten
Harps to listen, comb hair
Tear right to pieces
Left to recess a watery grave

Sensing the blood of prey
Swimming in fear for life

Rolling over
Falling into jaws
Teeth that chatter
It distracts them all

The Fiji mermaid
She will let it know
Time is coming
To feed and gnaw

The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

And so it was that later
As the Miller told his tale
That a face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

She said there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might just as well've been closed

And so it was later
As the Miller told his tale
AThat a face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

And ever since a young boy, I had the hunger in my eye
So when you cut the check, if you don't gimmie mine

Deep down to earth thinking
Leave out a nerp chicken
I should run, forfeit, and everything I know listen!

I was the misdirected
I was the least expected
Hop on and get rejected
Walk on and feel neglected
I feel like I'm the message
Unheard but I'm the message
I'm the last prolific remaining offer from the gutter

Shot was my girlfriend
When we was younger
Her I was scarred yo
Bullets I survived though
Death it's came easy
Truth the games needs me
Never let them see me down, smile while I'm bleeding

Smile when your struggling
Smile when you're in jail
Smile when your dead broke
Smile and the rents due
Smile you ain't got friends now
Smile and no one knows you
Never let them see you down smile while you bleeding
Smile when he leaves you
Smile cause girl he needs you
Smile plenty single mothers cry the tears you do
Smile despite the war
Smile despite the pain yo
Never let them see you down smile while you bleeding

To my man Kareem in prison
I can't speak your name
It hurt me that you never listened
It can't be the same
I had to grow my intuition
Had me deep in pain
'Cause I knew my options were either broke or the prison chains
I can't do it
I can't see it, look
Dammit, I can't blow it
I got a judge telling me my life's key
They will throw it
No sir
I plan to have a chauffeur
It seems to me this chopping crack is really going no where

Therefore
I'm resurrected
They call me
The poor injection
I infect you with the real
The dustyfeetphilosahectagos
I spit, so sick
I skid out
I'm fallin'
I'm shit outta luck and I'm trapped but I'll get out

Can you help me
I'm going crazy
My mom plays trix and I beat on the floor like bush wick
My fists bloody and blistered
A pair like I'm ballistic
I just stare at the red and smile while I'm bleeding

There are a few things you gotta take into account
I'm not an entertainer I've never been a clown
I was born where the mothers give birth while they frown
I would walk with the kids that would bra sound ah
Never really thought I'd make it to fourteen
And anybody wanted to fight I was most keen
Plus I had a little temper it was often foreseen
Yo say something bout my momma id shoot ya dead out clean
But ya gotta keep in mind that I grew up Mogadishu (tell em)
The only law was gun law
And we don't walk with a pistol
You get laughed at for being so insensitive to the environment
Cause how will you be heard when those big boys are firin'
War is no place for a child
Especially if hes rollin' with an ak and a smile
He had witnesses on mother bloody in a towel
But please, please, please, please
But never let 'em see you down smile while you bleedin'"

Gathered in the forest
Preparing their arms
Together they stand for valhall
Lords of the wolves
Till the day of crucial war

Years went by
When their fiend was banned
Land and honour were free
They gathered in fynn's tavern
Conferred about what has to be done
To protect their country knowingly
That the enemy will turn back
They decided to call the ancient ones
Who are resting in the woods

I call you, awake now, you brave ones
Dwellers of the fog
Raise your swords an fight against
The ones who attack us, at once

Woods waiting for the final call
No one will be spared, when day
Of war has come

Once by gone an era
The dwellers of the fog
With our fathers they stood
Side by side as in tales it's told

With horses formed by wrath
And blades made of fire

And have the preacher organize a 'vestigating committee

With Bentley out taking the lead
Followed by a tractor and a half lame mule

Faces beaming goodness and their jaw's set hard
Good people just doin' what's right
And off in the distance was Abell's house
And there wasn't a soul in sight
Aw, I could'a told you
(Oh, I just knew it)

Now the gravel was flying as he turned the bend
And screeched to a grinding halt
They went through the fence, into the flower bed
And hit pa's first-prize hog in the head
And left half a dozen mama's chickens for dead
But it wasn't nobody's fault

Oh, look at Harvey's prize hog
And all of them darlin' old grown bad trusty chickens
(We got more important things to tend to, boy)
I wonder if they're covered?

Committee bounded on the front porch
To meet the enemy face to face
But Abell yelled at 'em through the screen door

Sayin' with a Mona Lisa grin

Its piece of a puzzle
Piece of a trouble
Is it somethin' else?
Ure sellin yourself
I'm so wanting
Without a clue
Gotta find something better
Something better to do
Something so exciting
I'm into something new
You piece together the whole thing
Gives you something to use

Maybe I should practice it one more time
Maybe I'm afraid what it might do
Maybe it might upset someone
Maybe that's what its supposed to do

Pull it from the bottom
It begins to change
Find another existence
That's what ure trying to say?

I'm not pushin you out
I'm not pushin you off
I'm not pushin you out
I'm not pushin u

All of the lands are terribly restless
With tellin' you what to do
But you go bak to the land
Where ure defensless
They act just like me and u

Look what u've don't to me
Look what I've done to u
Look what they've done to us
Now were like no one else
Theyre laughin' at u
Talkin' about u
All these new things
All these new things
I found in use

And I'm workin so hard
When I think it is real
Everybody does once
Just to see how it feels
It's not a sensation
And it's not for sale
So what can you call it now?

Keep 'em gotten
They'll spoil you rotten
Keep 'em gotten
Keep 'em gotten

Be another freak

oot joskus rakastanut mua

Only because she got some money for me and shit
I think about fuckin' her

And go fuck my other bitch that live in fuckin' big houses
I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do but check it
How you spell cash? C's and some hash
At last, a nigga kickin' game full blast

How you want it, diamonds or dimeelles
Jan sport book bags and bags from Chanel
And seebeeaki, smellin' up my Kawasaki
Jawns by Versace all them joints by Jockey

Clock me workin' real hard for a nickel
He drive a tricycle and his pants too little
And his shoes too little
Won't you get with the clique with the big ass dicks

That make sure your kicks fit
The real shit, true, balla pack steel shit
The nigga with, the movie and the mill shit
Mass appeal get me in the clubs for free

So all you got to do for me is just
Make your way to my king sized bed
And lie on my pillows and my Gucci bed spread
Keep your pussy, I got other plans instead
Just gimme some head, gimme some head

Ride a dick till he bust shit I know I won't

A waste of a good dick if you ask me

I like a nigga like to put his back in it
If it's a weave fuck around and pull a track in it
All I get, few strokes that's it
This bomb ass shit's got your cigarettes lit

Who me, forced to use plan B, masturbate, play with the pussy
This nigga here bust off snorin'
He straight, I knew this date would be borin'
I wanna wake him up to do his duty

Nigga use that tongue, click the booty, click the booty
You wanna steal the pussy like a thief
Now kiss the lips without the teeth
So I could bust a nut or two come clean like Jeru

If you ain't lickin' no butts, we don't want it, we don't want it

Nine out of ten women, want to spit, on the skin of Blake Carrington
But I need much more to get raw, dick to jaw, dick to jaw
You drinkin' babies, don't wanna hear baby strictly, yes boo
Well if he cum up on your chest slow

If not then your not down with me
Little Caesar, Van Clef, or B.I.G.
Capone, Nino, or Bugsy
Don't ask Kim for a date, she want her pussy ate

Its more on roc when the Mobb walks in
Shit gets hot like a ill pot of grits spilled on you
Spit fire with nines but never squealed on you

I understood you should try to take my life
If I was you I would too damn right
If I had drama with a nigga like such as myself
I couldn't even sleep at night until...
I made things right
Pull out guns exchange a fight
Be the first to let off mines ignite the pipes...
And never let the daylight deceive
During the suns' hours niggaz do bleed
Aim for the waist and something on the top gets shot
Niggaz can't shoot never made a thing drop
Keep cream of the crop
Fresh out of box shit filled to the top
Smell the barrell when its bolt-locked nigga

Quickly while I'm pissy they're just bitches that's a little to frisky
Risky on point hope these cats is getting the point whisper out my name

And never keep your shit too far from your hand

The sounds of the city sifting through trees
Settle like dust on the shoulders of the old friends

Across the Red Sea like God had planned
Well, you'd think that when He opened up that mighty sea
That all the people would surely believe

But you can heal the sick
Raise the dead
Turn the sky from a blue to a red
It don't matter what they hear or what they see
Some people they never believe

Noah was the only man on earth that was good
So God said, ""Build an ark of resinous wood.""
Well, a lot of people laughed and called him a fool
But Noah didn't mind 'cause he knew for sure

That you can heal the sick
Raise the dead
Turn the sky from a blue to a red
It don't matter what they hear or what they see
Some people they never believe

Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego
Were told that in the fireplace they must go
Well, you'd think that when the people saw
They just wouldn't burn
That all the doubters would finally learn

That you can heal the sick
Raise the dead
Turn the sky from a blue to a red
It don't matter what they hear or what they see
Some people they never believe

Jesus came to earth to save all men
To take upon Himself a world of sin
But the people didn't care what He said or He did
They only knew that they wanted Him dead

Though He healed the sick
Yes, He raised the dead
Though He could turn the sky from a blue to red
It didn't matter what they'd heard or what they'd seen
Some people refused to believe

A lot of people now are dying in sin
Waiting for a miracle to prove to them
But though miracles keep happening again and again
They still don't believe and they never will

'Cause you can heal the sick
Raise the dead
Turn the sky from a blue to red
It don't matter what they hear or what they see
Some people they never believe."

Way out there in the prairie air I guess it's in my hide
Oh the clickety clack of the railroad track is callin'
If a man could know where the Santa Fe goes when she gets under steam
And the big loud bell that bongs farewell to hear her whistle scream
She's bound to go where there ain't no snow a fallin'
One more ride
One more ride

I miss the gloom of the prairie moon that seemed to know my name
And the tumbleweed where the prairie don't feed I miss them just the same
They're all a part of a song of heart I'm sayin'
I recall the tune that I sang to the moon and it seemed to make it smile
And I rode away at the close of day and I stayed so long awhile
But I long to be where the memory is ringing
One more ride
One more ride

As the years go by I wonder why I longed to leave my home
And to hit the trail of the iron rail away out there alone
But my heart would sigh till I know that I am leavin'
If I don't come back on a oneway track way down from Mexico
You could find me there or any old where that a tumbleweed will grow
It's a goodbye now you'll never know how I'm grievin'

C'mon man - oh my fucking God man...
Oh shit, what the fuck did I do?
It's all my fucking fault man, it's all my fucking fault
Fuck man, fuck am I doing man, why man
Why God, why did you have to take her? Fuck...

(Sticky)
Why? Why? Why God why?
Everything I love always seems to die
Answer me, speak to me, I don't hear you
Answer me, motherfucker I ain't scared of you
Is there even a God? Do you even exist?
What I gotta do to speak to you slit my wrists?
I'm talking to a God that I can't see
Can you see me? Can you see me?

(God)
Are you confused my son, and scared?
Let me make things more clear, so you're more aware

(Sticky)
Fuck who was that all this shit is freaking me

(God)
It is I God did you not say you wanted to speak with me?

(Sticky)
Bullshit I am talking to myself, I'm going insane

(God)
You are talking to yourself we are one of the same

(Sticky)
It can't be it must be the drugs I'm high
And if you are then why are we born if we live to die?
Is there life after death? What were we before birth?
Why is this whole earth plagued and cursed?
Is killing a sin is there life in other planets?
Is adultery wrong did you write the ten commandments?

(God)
Excuse me my son, one question at a time
We were never born, and we will never die
In the essence, there Is no such thing as death
How could I write commandments and not have them kept?
The soul is eternal you just change form
Then you come back with a new face on
You can not limit love unless you lack understanding
To answer you yes there is life in other planets
The futures a mystery the past is history
Today is a gift that's why it is called the present
Life is so simple unless you make it confusing
The wise ones stand us and the clever we are using

(Sticky)
Wait - God, there is so much I want to ask you
God, God? Where are you? God I need to talk to you

If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God

(Sticky)
Tell me, are there psychics that can speak telepathically?

(God)
Yes but if you use more than one tenth of the minds capacity

(Sticky)
I can't think I feel life going down the drain
In the streets everywhere I am surround in pain

(God)
Don't think, your thoughts are just that- thoughts
Your feelings will really erase what you been taught
Feelings are the language of the soul the soul is truth
I speak through you to aware the youth

(Sticky)
But why let the suffering go on why not just stop it?

(God)
In order for anything to exist, so much is opposite
How can there be left if there was never right?
How can something know death if it never knew life?
How can you lose, if nobody won?
How can it be dark if there was never a sun?
That which is not grandeur, the soil still blessed
Form must exist for part of themself to manifest

(Sticky)
But I never asked to be born, I hate my life
And if you are God dammit then show me the light
And tell me- what's the meaning of life?

(God)
The process of all life
Is an ongoing, never-ending process of recreation of self

(Sticky)
Is God a he or she is there one true religion?

(God)
I'm the Alpha, the Omega, the beginning and ending
We are all one and everything is living

If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God"

I walked away the wind blows
And any way the wind goes will be good enough for me

But I walk my weary way lost and alone

Keep flashin' through my mind to warm me

I'm a creep, I sleep around just to kill the pain
And although, now I know she does the same I wonder who's 2 blame?
Who's 2 blame???
I played the game
She does the same
She played that game
So who's 2 blame?
Blame each other for another cheap romance

And I was just the one of the hands
Who hearded ten thousand cattles
On their ten thousand acres of land.

But I was a very poor cowboy
And we lived in worlds far apart
So how could I tell her I loved her
Or speak of the love in my heart.

The lady I loved never knew

A poor cowboy's heart broke in two.

Or notice that I'm even gone

Now rides through the dark night alone.

You made so sure of that you
Tried to keep me down here
Your complacency has been your downfall

Nobody made you king of the world
And now I'm here to dethrone
So kiss the ring motherfucker
It's my time, my time to shine
Grasping for the straws as they fall
Maybe you'll make a splint 
For your broken ego
For your broken ego

And I say thank you for the scars 
And the guilt and the pain
Every tear I never cried
Has sealed your fucking fate
Did you take me for a fool
Or were you just too blind to see
That every effort made has failed
And there is no destroying me?

Hate can be a positive emotion
When it forces you to better yourself
You built me, constructed my desire, perfected my hatred
Now I'm driven to be 
Ten times better than you think you are
Ten times better than you think you are

Piece by piece I built my walls and burned my bridges down
That lead back to people like you
So full of malice, so full of scorn
You tried your best to crush my spirit
You tried to steal my soul
You pushed my back against the wall
And I broke it down

I will not be broken, though I am the one that bleeds
I will not be broken, I am the one
I will not be broken, though I am the one that bleeds
I will not be broken, I am the one

I will not be broken, though I am the one that bleeds
I will not be broken, I am the one

And I say thank you for the scars 
And the guilt and the pain
Every tear I never cried

Even the earth is movin in different places in outer space
But one thing remains the same till the end of time
I think I'll remain, I think I'll just stay...

A b-boy standin in my b-boy stance

From the top of the highest summit, again we run it.
A hundred and forty four shimmering lights stunnin
Too quick for the human eye to catch a glimpse
You know pimps cannot convince with bigger attempts of emcee'in,
Blowing words in the wind,
While we ascend to limitless ends and pretend
We're still human, when if fact we're only half
The other path extends infinity do the max
I try to laugh, but they pull me down like crabs in a bucket
With hands in my pocket, how long will it last?
Heaven only knows, so Kheaven keeps inventing the flows
That turns black prose to white foes
Your just supposin have you heard my words
Moving at light speed and getting blurred.
It's all so incredible decibles at glance standing in a b-stance

A B-boy standin in my B-boy stance

This one leads the way...
Now cut it up, cut it up back to back, on the wheels of steel, cut it up back to back

Elevate, Meditate, eliminate
Thoughts from my past keep knocking upon my gate
Shouldn't let 'em in, the answers not to debate
But to observe the debating and then we can all escape

Yo party people listen up at the drop of the dime,
They took cameras to Africa for pictures to rhyme
Over oh... yes, the great pretenders
Religious entertainers who want to be life savers
Damn... another dollar for the mind, another cold ??? hoping
They can't find, they can't copy or get pictures with no lines,
I guess it's just a case of the blind leading the blind
But, I'm flippin and steppin and rockin' the roll,
Taking control, payin' my tolls, losing control
I'm playin' a role so people will remember that
I'm just a servant of rap, hopin to bring it back

I'm a B-boy standin in my B-boy stance

This one leads the way... break

I'm just a B-Boy calling death to Troy"

Distant screams morph into lullabies 
We beat indifferent drum, we pound it till we're numb 

We validate, rationalize, corroborate each others lives 
Pat my back and I'll pat yours, benevolent conquistadors 
We piss down throats, shit in cupped hands 
Wipe our asses with all foreign flags 
We beat indifferent drum, we pound it till we're numb

Hitting mad sparks
Pass me the mic and I'll be rocking the whole park

Crack the hit then fucked it up, and baby gangstas was full of they cluck.
Pluck the feathers up off the duck, you stuck like chuck if carried the banter
Pistol player knuckled up, then better to telling the children to scatter
Everyone knows don't fuck with them ho's drinking with keisha from out they yo
Full of that clearly pop a silly when niggas first heard the choppers city
And I was a dancin' b-boy who resorted to slinging them heat boys
And jackin' them cars, mackin' them broads, sadistic shit, then flipped the script.
I don't wan' sound like a hypocrite, but momma raised me for greatness,
But we broke as fuck and hope is stuck and New Orleans defines the cage hits
The animal house like getting out like takin' food from a animals mouth,
Roar roar like the dungeon dragon, takin' it back to the cannibals house

Them niggas are hazards, we bitchin' they crabbin', and changin lanes like benjamin massing
From 10 to 12 they thinkin' it's cool, something awful when they ain't in the mood.
Don't get 'em bent, fuck that innocence, cause in a sense they film as you.
Where they mommas at, where they mommas at? Nobody knows, nobody cares.
To claim your hard, come go through the ward, come fuck with them, when nobody dares
Your job, yes, ya ho-jocker, put that pop on you like Redenbacher
The things they say, the slang they use, catching kung fu while they bangin' the tools.

When the gun goes bang bang bang, who's gonna know the one? No, nobody knows.
When the gun goes bang bang bang, who's gonna know the one? No, nobody knows.

Where that nigga disrespect and then snuffed your balls

Waiting for you niggaz to dunk

There's a rumbling in the skies
I've been wading through the high muddy water
With the heat rising in my eyes

Every day your memory grows dimmer
It doesn't haunt me like it did before
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

When I was in Missouri
They would not let me be
I had to leave there in a hurry
I only saw what they let me see

You broke a heart that loved you
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
I've been walking that lonesome valley
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

People on the platforms
Waiting for the trains
I can hear their hearts a-beatin'
Like pendulums swinging on chains

When you think that you've lost everything
You find out you can always lose a little more
I'm just going down the road feeling bad
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

I'm going down the river
Down to New Orleans
They tell me everything is gonna be all right
But I don't know what ""all right"" even means

I was riding in a buggy with Miss Mary Jane
Miss Mary Jane got a house in Baltimore
I been all around the world, boys
Now I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

Gotta sleep down in the parlor
And relive my dreams
I'll close my eyes and I wonder
If everything is as hollow as it seems

Some trains don't pull no gamblers
No midnight ramblers, like they did before
I been to Sugartown, I shook the sugar down
Now I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door"

In a lonely iridescence
It's terribly deep
And the cold is complete
And it only lacks a presence
And nothing else

It's on breaker 1, 2 mike checkin'

When I release the funky weapon
Like Ricochet ping ping ping.
I make fans fell it even when I sing.
The green eyed bandit coming funky with the tune yes
I'm blowing up like Tom Berringer in Platoon.
I'm playing kinda ruff like Zapp
Whapp and E-Double smack to all the crossover raps black
Who ain't down with the format
When you should be wearing khakis and not dress slacks
That's wack
You trippin' you better wake up and smell the coffee
And then back up off me
I serious I can't believe some people letting frontiers in
And then compare them equal boy you must be buggin
You lucky you don't catch a slug in the chest in
From the Smith and Wessons.
Change the out look
Change the cover of the book
You hip hop crook and give back what you took.
It's the Funk coming at cha
So don't let the crossover catch ya.
Boy stay real.

II.

It's on again yeah about the fake hip hop trends
For those who can't comprehend just ask your friends
They know the real deal of rap music no frontin
You can't be talking loud and saying nothing
You must be true to the game you understand
And if not I could kill you man
For being false plus extra fake on the tape
Talking hardcore when you soft like a piece of cake.
You can't put nothing pass me that horrendous cause
I've been here since strictly business
The era of Eric and Rakim, Biz, Public Enemy, Run-DMC,
Houdini, The Beasties, Stetsa, Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff, LL
When he was rockin' bells.
Sucker which fake emcee is rearranging the structure band
The motherf--ker. And don't let this happen again
Cause rap could be gone the wind.
So stay real.

III.

Yes I'm back Black for those who might be confused
And lost and don't wanna pay the cost
Of me hardcore style type a human being
On the microphone when I be emceeing.
Some fake the Funk and Main Source know it
How do I know cause MTV shows it.
Clowns that should be beat down on the spot
And catching nothing but speed knots the bumbadots
I insist we veto all fake emcees and wanna be's
That's worst than the AIDS disease.
So wake up Spike Lee Joint
And don't be a knucklehead and get to the point
With the Funk and pump up the volume
Make the wild tune to make the party boom
Peace to Redman the Rap Funkadelic
The only emcee that's compared to Erick because I'm real."

Stand with my head held high

The wonder of love will light up the sky

Out where the thunder roars
See it shine, a seal of time

All the needy people

But for whom the angels sing
And who would have tho't that as He grew
And with other children played
This child with whom they laughed and sang
Would die for them some day
And who would have tho't this little child
Could make a blind man see
Feed the hungry make rich the poor
And set the sinner free
Oh who would have tho't this little child
Was who the prophets said
Would take away the sins of man
And rise up from the dead

O I believe and I will always sing
This little child is the King
O I believe and I will always sing
This little child
He is the King of kings

Many years have come and gone
Yet this world remains the same
Empires have been built and fallen
Only time has made a change
Nation against nation
Brother against brother
Men so filled with hatred
Killing one another
And over half the world is starving
While our banner of decency is torn
Debating over disarmament
Killing children before they're born
And fools who march to win the right
To justify their sin
Oh ev'ry nation that has fallen
Has fallen from within
Yet in the midst of this darkness
There is a hope a light that burns
This little child the King of kings
Some day will return

And I believe and I will always sing
This little child is the King
And I believe and I will always sing
This little child
He is the King of kings

And who would have tho't this little child
Is who the prophets said
Will return to judge this world
The living and the dead
Oh can't you see that long ago
So very far away
This little child our only hope
Was born a King that day
And can't you see that here and now
As unto Him we pray
This Lord of lords who is our hope
Is still King today
He's still the King today"

But it's okay if he's girl
Oh, these things that grow out of
The things that we give

We should move to the west side
They still believe in things
That give a kid half a chance

When he pulled off the road
Step in a waltz of ted moon-beams
Said he fit an APB,
A robbery nearby

And he go for his wallet
And they thought he was going for a gun
And the cops blew Bird away

Some girls listen to records all day in their rooms
But what do birds leave behind, of the wings that they came with
If a son's in a tree building model planes?

This blood drenched man, seemed to cry for help, as he stared at me, his eyes were changing.
Rising to his feet, incapacitated, puking violently, charging straight for me.
With his mouth opened wide drooling intensely, I leapt the fence and ran inside.
In the house I hide, barricading everything, what would come next?
Terrified, running up the stairs, finally found the shotgun kept under my bed.
It's time to put an end to this nightmare; I'll end your life as quickly as I chose to save it.
Removing the Debris only to see, the starving man behind me, as he pounced I never had a chance.

Taking him to the white lands
Of Empathica
Of Innocence

Innocence

II. ""Home""

The dreamer and the wine
Poet without a rhyme
A widowed writer torn apart by chains of hell

One last perfect verse
Is still the same old song
Oh Christ how I hate what I have become

Take me home

Getaway, runaway, fly away
Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway
I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Forgive me
I have but two faces
One for the world
One for God
Save me
I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world

My home was there 'n then
Those meadows of heaven
Adventure-filled days
One with every smiling face

Please, no more words
Thoughts from a severed head
No more praise
Tell me once my heart goes right

Take me home

Getaway, runaway, fly away
Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway
I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Forgive me
I have but two faces
One for the world
One for God

III. ""The Pacific""

Sparkle my scenery
With turquoise waterfall
With beauty underneath
The Ever Free

Tuck me in beneath the blue
Beneath the pain, beneath the rain
Goodnight kiss for a child in time
Swaying blade my lullaby

On the shore we sat and hoped
Under the same pale moon
Whose guiding light chose you
Chose you all

""I'm afraid, so afraid
Being raped again, and again, and again
I know I will die alone
But loved

You live long enough to hear the sound of guns
Long enough to find yourself screaming every night
Long enough to see your friends betray you

For years I've been strapped unto this altar
Now I only have three minutes and counting
I just wish the tide would catch me first and give me a death I always longed for""

IV. ""Dark Passion Play""

Second robber to the right of Christ
Cut in half - infanticide
The world will rejoice today
As the crows feast on the rotting poet

Everyone must bury their own
No pack to bury the heart of stone
Now he's home in hell, serves him well
Slain by the bell, tolling for his farewell

The morning dawned, upon his altar
Remains of the dark passion play
Performed by his friends without shame
Spitting on his grave as they came

Getaway, runaway, fly away
Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway
I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Forgive me
I have but two faces
One for the world
One for God
Save me
I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Whore for the cold world
Whore for the cold world

Many cracks in a mask that hides disgrace

'Cause I was choking on the dust from your empty mind

A counterfeit will break

Who turned out the light?
But hatch from the things, I don't know what it means
But it was too much to bear.

If I had taken my time, counted my steps
I might have no regrets
You might still be here yet and not in my dreams
It's too late to care.

I was born of the womb of a poisonous man
Beaten and broken and chased from the land
But I rise up above it, high up above it and see
I was hung from the tree made of tongues of the weak
The branches, the bones of the liars and thieves
Rise up above it, high up above and see

Pray to your god, open your heart
Whatever you do, don't be afraid of the dark
Cover your eyes, the devil's inside

One night of the hunter
One day I will get revenge
One night to remember
One day it'll all just end, oh

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Blessed by a bitch from a bastard's seed
Pleasure to meet you but better to bleed
Rise, I will rise, I will rise
Skinned her alive, ripped her apart
Scattered her ashes, buried her heart
Rise up above it, high up above and see

Pray to your god, open your heart
Whatever you do, don't be afraid of the dark
Cover your eyes, the devil inside

One night of the hunter
One day I will get revenge
One night to remember
One day it'll all just end, oh

Kid watch your back one time it's comin' always
They lock me up for 12 days I can't comprehend
Now I'm a free man on the streets again
Chasin' St. Ides down with some Seagrams Gin
Life is like a dice game and I'm into win
On the scene from the 41st side of Queens
We get the cream laid up love love for dame
'Cause I mean what I mean, I'm out to claim king
Doin' my thing, do wild stakes my namell reign

To all my peoples locked down comin' back to life
In the world once again though ya fear was trife
While you was gone, we was goin' to war and even more
Saw my man layin' dead on the floor, kid I swore
That our crew will live forever, I guess I was wrong
No, until we meet again, hold ya head and stay strong (yeah)
Yo, got my mind on a place to hide from police (where)
Sweatin' dogs as I'm runnin' cross 12th Street
Just as I approach the block
I spot a jake on the creep down by Vicks weed spot (so what)
Made a you-ey up the hill plus a change of plans
I had to hurry back so I could warn my man

Ya had me stressin' little son, had my heart rapidly pumpin'
Niggas start a guttin' behind the bushes duckin'
My ears rung, I punch a clip into the guns
Got in the arm, one slug hit my son
He was bleedin' from the head I couldn't believe it
We was defeated if it was a case I couldn't beat it
Felt like cryin' (the temperatures risin')
I saw my man helpless, damn near on the verge of dyin'
So to P I passed the iron

Kid you ain't lyin'
I went to stash the murder weapon, plus I'm relyin'
On a door to be open, goin' in the building, it's a trap
Police buckin' at me, they try to twist my tongue back
Jetted up the staircase to the third floor
Reached behind the sink, throw the heater on the floor
Locked the door, police grabbed me up and tried to break my jaw
So where's the gun we saw? (I don't know)
We know you was there at the homicide scene (I know nuttin')
And if it wasn't you, was somebody from ya team

(Chrous)
From the cradle to the grave
(From the cradle to the grave)

(Repeat: x2)
Straight from the motherfuckin' cradle to the grave

Yo, it's the real drama kills, nobody moves, stand still
Bottle you drop that ass off in a land fill
Son bless me with the iron, I got beef
With some niggas from the other side over some weak shit
Load up the heaters, greet 'em with the hollow tips
Flip 'em like the Gotti clip my crew shift the body shift
The cradle to the grave is where I'll end up
Fuck gettin' sent up north, son I'm better
Doin' my dirt on a low
Fuckin' wit them mobbers like a crowd
No doubt you gonna blow you never know
He didn't even have to go there
Unprepared now he's six below
Why know I'm chillin', I gots no time for catchin' feelings
Get that money I wants, some brothers want to act funny
But it's all good I still die for the hood

For my peoples, yeah knock on wood
Triple L, rollin' dice while I put you on
To the drama what I gotta say is short not long
This nigga that I'm beginning to dislike he got me fed
If he doesn't discontinue his bullshit he might be dead
Know him well and probably go way back
But I don't care if he's your man doin' shit like that
I hope the word gets back to him, 'cause I screw him
He shitted on my man and we got plans to do him
Let's get it over with quick, I'm tired of waitin'
Ain't no fair overhead there we just debatin' on when and how
Later on right now, spoke to Killa yesterday

He said to chill for a while
But it's hard acting like everything is all right
I get the chills when I see that nigga in my sight
A dead man walking not only that he's still talkin'(about what)
About how what he did buried off and you don't know
How much I fiend to put his ass in a coffin
One day my man and the next he's not
Didn't know him long anyway so fuck it
It's funny how things change (word up)

Word up man
Why know what I'm sayin' we gonna die
It's for real, kid no games bein' played"

To another extent than the clever boy

And runs a little bit late

It all began on the street, to the back of a blue police vehicle
Next come the bookends, the way things is looking
It's Friday, you in for a long stay, gettin' shackled on the bus
First thing come Monday, hoping in your mind you'll be released one day
But knowing, home is a place you're not going for a long while
Now you're up on the isle, in a position that you ain't got to, refusing
To smile
But keep in mind there's a brighter day, after your time spent
Used to be wild, but locked up, you can't get bent
Thought you could hack it, now you're requesting Pee, see you fragile
It ain't hard to see, niggas like that don't associate with me
I'd rather, get busy to the third degree
Cause the war populations are
If this was the street, my razor would be a mack demon
Hit you up, leave your whole face screaming, what you in for kid
Busting nuts, taps heard of million street stories caught inside this trap
Who are you to look at me with your eyes like that
Wising up young blood, before you make things escalate, and I would hate
To set your crooked ass straight

Make your moves at night, pack your heat in this warzone, niggas is trife
Runnin' from one time, ain't no time to slip, make one false move
And it's a up north trip
Livin' the high life, make your moves at night, pack your heat in this warzone
Niggas is trife, runnin' from one time, ain't no time to slip, make one
False move And it's a up north trip

Verse Two: Havoc

You tried to dip, duck, but still got bucked, you talk too much shit
You should have kept your mouth shut, all that gossip
Motherfucker don't you know my glock kicks, hollow tips
To your body, mad toxic, I fade you, blow you with a rusty-ass razor
Did you a favor, tried to wet you but I grazed you
Pop goes the glock when there's beef on the block, chill for a while
Make them think the beef stop, then I creep like a thief in the night
It's only right, ain't no turnin' back, it's on tonight, and if I get caught
Then my ass is up north, straight on the course for upstate New York
Stress, smokin' back to back cigaretttes, it popped off, gon' point in
The mess hall
But to avoid that, from head to toe, dipped in all black, hit them niggas
Where they pump they cracks at, Havoc, with the murder masterplan
Keep my nine up to par, so my shit won't jam, God forbid if my shit do
Run behind a tree, fix my shit then hit you, slugs in your body
Mainly in your brain tissue, witness from the scene, get ghost, stash
The pistol
So simple then, watch my back, lay up and relax, roll a sack, ?K-A black?
Find a shorty intact

Verse Three: Prodigy

I got the powder, combine wit the powder, and water, it oughtta
Drop in a half and hour, in the, form of oil, watch the cocaine boil
Keep my eye on it so the shit won't spoil, then I pause
And ask God why, did he put me on the serve, just so I could die
I sit back and build on, all the things I did wrong, why I'm still breathing
And all my friends gone, I try not to dwell on the subject for a while
'Cause I might get stuck in this corrupt lifestyle, but my
Heart pumps foul blood through my arteries, and I can't turn it back
It's a part of me, too late for cryin, I'm a grown man struggling
To reach the next level of life, without fumbling, down to folding
I got no shoulder to lean on but my own, all alone in this danger zone
Time waits for no man, the streets grow worse, fuck the whole world kid
My money comes first, 'cause I'm out for the gusto, and trust nobody
If you're not family, then you die by me, cause niggas will have you
Locked up
The snitch, be a man, givin' police the run down on your plans
We're never goin' down like that, so I, shut my mouth and hold my words back
The legal business, forever mine, fuck payin' taxes, the last kid that shitted

And gave police access, to my blueprints, used names as evidence
Skipped town and I haven't seen the snitch nigga ever since
The moral of the story is easy to figure out, a lesson that you can't
Live without

Repeat Chorus once
*Livin' the high life"

You ever want something
That you know you shouldn't have
The more you know you shouldn't have it,
The more you want it
And then one day you get it,
It's so good too
But it's just like my girl
When she's around me
I just feel so good, so good
But right now I just feel cold, so cold
Right down to my bones
'Cause ooh...
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away

I know, I know, I know, I know,
I know, know, know, know, know,
I know, I know,
Hey I ought to leave
I ought to leave her alone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone

(Black Thought)
Yo my definition is a lyricist for hire
My vocal's a passport that never expire
Crowd loud like fifty rounds of gun fire
Screamin out ""The Roots"" while I balance wit the wire
Yo, expert in this profession, the session
In 1987, I linked up wit the ?uestion
Eleven years later we shared crop wit Geffen
In musical hell, but hip-hop forever heaven
My thoughts, interwoven and deep like Beethoven
This foul world so filled of shit it like a clogged up colon
Swollen wit minds that got stolen
Fake-ass cops, uncontrollable patrolmen
Torture, blood flow like bodies of water
Fathers sexually assaultin they own daughter
Out of sync, outta order like a puzzle
In the land of the unseen hand that hold juggle
In a Game of Life, yo it's hard to roll a double
Tryin' times, take lives and separate couples
Kids thinkin' they grown, tellin' they moms ""Fuck you""
Under they breath, livin' in the last times left
Peep the imagery ?strep?, across the sky like a canvas
And we're the artists beneath vigorous rough strokes of darkness
Time to set it off, let's spark this
Switzerland, LET'S SPARK THIS!
We are the ULTIMATE (rock-rockin' it)
We are the ULTIMATE (rock-rockin' it)
We are the ULTIMATE, rock-rockin' it, rock-rockin' it, rock-rockin' it

We are the ULTIMATE LOUDER! (rock-rockin' it)
We are the ULTIMATE
(Rock-rockin' it) C'mon (Rock-rockin' it) C'mon (Rock-rockin' it)
Yo my definition is a lyricist for hire
You couldn't have a clue, it's about to transpire
The books I buy live arms ?I wire?
The Fifth, similar to ghetto gospel choir
We ex-plore the whole states plus record
In flight buds, trip that was a prisoner in war
Four-four the corridor, seal it, no floor
But I could see the drop was a mile aboard
To the bottom, electrical shock for rhymes
I said ""I don't got em"", guess it kinda presented a problem
When I understood, they said ""Let him go""
I woke, during a center to London?
And now wit a past, fuckin' wit border patrol
I'm findin it out, I'm leakin wit my people
Hit the studio, spread this information
In daze of frustration fogged the education
&gt;From Illa-Fifth to Switzerland destination
The Roots du journ, go check the translation
The dictionary of devout topics, far from ebonics
The Fifth Dynast, they can't stop it
Yo Zurlich y'all keep it tight heed
While The Roots Crew smoke weed
Yo, we are the ULTIMATE (rock-rockin' it)
We are the ULTIMATE, say what? (rock-rockin' it)
We are the ULTIMATE, c'mon
(Rock-rockin' it) C'mon c'mon rock-rockin' it, rock-rockin' it
We are the ULTIMATE (rock-rockin' it)
We are the ULTIMATE LOUDER (rock-rockin' it)
We are the ULTIMATE LOUDER
(Rock-rockin' it) C'mon rock-rockin' it, rock-rockin' it
They go *Thought starts humming and Scratch does his thing*

Qu'est ce qui s'ront le prochain printemps

Qui d'un dernier souffle refleurit
