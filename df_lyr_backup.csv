That shines over me, that shines over me?
And how will I live if you take all the give
That you have for me, that you have for me?

Without so madly
Without so fast
Yet still we
Remain

How will I love if you take all the life
From out of me, right from out of me?
Tell me, how will I live if you take all the give
That you give to me?

We burned so brightly
Love so fast
Yet still we remain

Oh
Oh

'Cause we'll live
And we give
Today

I, yeah
But don't'cha know?
You know, you know, you know
I know you know
And I said, oh, yeah
But don't'cha know?
You know, you know, you know

3,TRAUVAQ128F92DC677.h5,Fake Problems,Tabernacle Song,"We've almost got job security,
At least there's a roof over our heads.
There are beds in our rooms,
And warm plates of food
Waiting to be had.

We're not asking 
If they want anything,
But we'll take 
What you can give.
I can honestly say
At this point in my life,
I'm grateful for what I get.

So hey,
Why am I trying to escape,
When everything I need is right here
At home?

I read that every good sermon
It starts with a story
To reel the audience in.
But I've got no life experience,
Just this terrible fear
That I'll captivate anything.
If I really have your attention
I'm desperate for the affection
Of a full capacity room.
As sweat seeps from my pores
I race for the door
And don't want it anymore.

So hey,
Why am I trying to escape,
When everything I need is right here?

But the neighbors just called
You didn't make it that far.
They saw ya picking flowers 
From their yard.
Well hip, hip, hooray
What a wonderful escape.
And the way that I see
I see nothing at all,
I'm blindfolded in the backseat
Of a car.
Just drop me somewhere,
I can't retrace my steps.

Can I come back yet
To the only place
That clears my head?
To my home.

Yes, I learned my lesson,
But I'll always be restless,
I can assure you of that.
Even in the kingdom of heaven
I'll be asking the question,
""What's it like in hell""?"

We offer this sacrifice
That we will live just as He died
Willing to pay the price
Willing to pay the price

How Beautiful the radiant bride
Who waits for her Groom with His light in her eyes
How Beautiful when humble hearts give
The fruit of pure lives so that others may live

But when the nighttime comes, hey-hey
There's this cat down there that makes a bad kinda soup
I come around struttin' my luck in my shoop coupe
Cecil gives me coffee
And he won't never take my coin
I say, "" I got thirty dollars in my pocket!
Whatchoo doin' ? ""

I holler, "" Come on, Cecil, take a dollar!
Come on, Cecil, take a ten!
I've finally geared up into a whole buncha big ones
And you're actin' like I'm down-shiftin' ""

He knows all the under-riders on the boulevard
They got to barefoot cruise when it's forty-weight hard
They look particularly dead-beat
Permanently pale
Cecil picks up his butcher knife
Waves it at the jail
The kid say, "" I ain't got no dough, Joe, I just want some o.j""
I said, "" Don't look at me "" ('Cause he was lookin' my way)
Cecil wink upon him some juice and some green
And the kid walks over and puts the quarter in the pinball machine
And he says, "" Come on, Cec, gimme a dollar
Come on Cecil gimme five
I'm in a half-way house on a one-way street
And I'm a quarter past left alive""

He can talk about your people till your hair turns grey

quiero ser un novato, alguien que nunca ha sido,
te quiero, te quiero, te quiero y quiero o√≠dos en tu cama.

tengo miedo porque presiento que he sido poco frente a tus ojos,
dime que s√≠ me quieres, dime s√≥lo esa mentira,

Loves with a passion called hate

(But you must Rick) I can't, I can't manage
(But you must Rick) Ah, shit

Hoes ass kiss 'cause I'm like Jason, vision
Releasin' me a basket case from prison - Pissed
Blood feenin', the villain like 'Wassup y'all
Deep down schemin' how to kill 'em
Misleadin' a bit, although proceedin' a hit
I made 'em feel I'd never jeopardise my freedom for shit
Played the empty headed part,
Though the moment they dreaded start, neat
Back of the head and took the credit card
Seen properly decease,
Made it look like an everyday robbery to police
And I's out
Police believed a thief pop for sureity, a jerky
Alert the rest to beef up security
And not to get flashy, although another blast occurred
Another brother deservin' to get massacred
Pleasure in poppin' that flea
Should a heard mister tough guy coppin' mad pleas
Not insane, nor am I biased
Though feels good to watch a motherfucker die before
My fly ass
Ain't nuttin' to blast, fuck it
Then I put some crack vials in the ass pocket and was off
Police said a thug awaited, since I didn't leave no evidence
A drug related incident

I still clock the mil' figures, cock back triggers
Reason why your girlfriends dig us - 'cause I kill niggaz

You are my shining star, my guiding light, my thug fantasy
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my thug fantasy

Well I had it up to here, that's why a brother buckin' trife
And gettin' way with murder, this the motherfucking life
At a jam, nine figure on shelf
While your army a nigger snickering among self - thiefs
Who wanna clock the bread off the next
That's why I'm gonna blow their fucking head off
Maybe the victor get stuck up
Giving these clowns opportunity to fuck up
They knowin' that the kid crew showers, eye cowers
And leaves for 'bout a good two hours
While they're like 'we coulda caught Rick what, for allsort'
That's what the assholes thought
Tough guy mumblin', I thunderin'
Why I had a motherfucking A-K ya wondering
And raise it higher, start giving them the fire
As they scream like high pitch women like Mariah
Blood on the wall like, other brothers ball like they hit
Seein' shots split a motherfuckers skull like lettuce
Run a nigger best bet is for another duck in gage
I'm in a motherfucking rage
Mask 'bout face, Now figure dash
Smash 'bout 10 ta 15 nigger ass out
More enemy dug, deceased, caught
Had not, gave one fuck what police thought (what?)
But first I best provide all brainiacs
With evidence of a suicidal maniac

While I clock the mil' figures, cock back triggers
Reason why your girlfriends dig us - 'cause I kills niggaz"

Even though I would never say

And father, I'm in need of your hand
So I can face the world bravely
And father, do you understand
What it is you mean to me

Like a warrior you always conquered
Every battle you had to face
And through the hard times
When life was a bitter fight
It's you who would give
So unselfish you lived
A tribute to the world that blood
Is thicker than water

Now I just wanna get back to me
Oh baby, hoo hoo
Back into the man I used to be

Things that I said I wouldn't do, I did 'em
Secrets below the service of truth I hid 'em
This man kind is past, but can he erase
The tears of a million years is human race
Of animals, that talk and walk upright
Then slave all day and fall in a trance at night
Flowing the planet, trying to find missing links
Like the men we used to be and always suppose to think
Mysteries, maybe not
It's getting hot, we better configure the plot, but
I hold a pen with the grip so tight
That'a squeeze the ink out'ta the page, and write a song for the people
Came up from the underground, now I write above on a hovercraft sound
This microphone, like an an amphetamine
Keeping me clean, speaking in dreams
So nature can intervene, just for a scene

I tried it, I couldn't find it
Now I just wanna get back to me
Oh baby, hoo hoo
Back into the man I used to be

I walk along this path alone, my feet hurt
Lost some friends along the way, I did dirt
I went to church, I tried everything
From leaving my body, to watching the birds sing
For hours, so I could feel heavenly powers
Had been across the universe and inside of flowers
But what is it worth, I'm still just a man on the earth
Rappers are acting like man tan
Can I be candid, I can't stand it
Rap bandit, got heaven acting frantic
I wanna swing my sword decapitate
But what is a man if he acts like an ape
So I sit back, planning my great escape
Load up my EPS and peruse my record crate
The man I used to be, I can only see by looking beyond me
So what is reality, I don't know

I tried it, I couldn't find it
Now I just wanna get back to me
Oh baby, hoo hoo
Back into the man I used to be

Wrong song
You know what
I woke up in the morning
I took a trip to the corner store
That's when I heard my calling
But I'd never heard the voice of truth before
So I kept on walking
Pretended I didn't see
Walked by a window and my reflection said to me
You could try all the same
But you'll never know this mystery
There's no pilot on your plane
So you're not the man you used to be
Try all the game, but you'll never know this mystery
When your pilot has no plane
Said you're the man you used to be seen
Holla and ya holla, you folla you fall
Ya holler and ya holla, you folla you fall
Ya holler and ya holla, you folla you fall
Ya holler and ya holla, you folla you fall
Ya holler and ya holla, you folla you fall
Ya holler and ya holla, you folla you fall
Yo, microphones get ripped holding us back
K dash rocking it out, rocking the cold style
Making it up, go along singing my song
Woke up, in the early morn didn't know what was going on
Whatever, I don't really know
Flows like an immaculate goat what up, whatever"

But I need a little place in the sun sometimes or I think I will die

But everywhere is somewhere and nowhere is near
Everybody got somebody with their wine and their beer
So I'm just this tragic figure in the corner over here
With an empty apartment and a best friend who is a queer

Every time I see him he smiles 
And tells me how well he is walking these miles
But he never ever asks a single thing about me
If I die he'd hear about it eventually

Diamonds, roses I need Moses
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain

An everywhere is somewhere and nowhere is near

The scars to prove

And everything you do

Its magical
It brings me close to you
Close is true
I don't know what you do

And I remember when we started
Everything was so real
And there's no words to express
The way you make me feel

And lovin' you ain't hard
It's easy 'cause your beautiful
And who knows what's comin' next
Our sex is like a ritual

Ooh child
Baby girl you got a place in my heart
You either hold my life together
Or you break it apart

You really got a hold on me
Don't you ever let go
Don't you let me be
Till I tell you so

You on my mind all the time
Your so controlable
'Cause you oh so fine
And I'm claiming you as mine

Whoa-oh hey no
How low will I go
How high can I get
I've lost all control

Whoa-oh hey no
How far will we go
You got a hold on my soul
Don't you ever let go

Just come in

Love does not care
Just come in
Lay your heart right here
You should never fear

You think you've crossed
Some sacred line
And now I will ignore you
If you look up
You will find
My heart is still toward you
Look at the sky
The east to the west
That's where I threw this
When you first confessed
Let it go now

I will forgive you
No matter what you've done
No matter how many times
You turn and run
I love you

How much better off she would be
The longer I hold on and the longer this goes on
The harder that it's gonna be
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me
I've never deserved her God knows when I hurt her
That's the last thing that I want to do
She tries but she can't tell how she feels but I know
Too well what she's going through
If I love her so much I don't know why I can't do
The right thing and just let her be
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me

Last night I told her this time it's all over making
Ten times I've told her goodbye
Last night we broke up this morning I woke up
And for the tenth time I'm changing my mind
I saw more love in her eyes when I left her
Than most foolish men will ever see
And it's four in the morning and once more the dawning

I think you need to give us our space.
You know that we can raze this place
And leave you without a trace.
Storm trooper storm trooper why are you here
The youth them getting restless and they don't want you near.
Your watching us your watching us it so improper
We've seen your kind before we call it informer.
Storm trooper storm trooper where will you go?
This world she no like you so you better stay low.
And up from the mountains and out from the trees,
That is where you come from you crawl like the one disease.

So now you pass me the laser beam
And you want me to join the team.
Well I'm not used to these kinds of things,
But this is what the evil brings.
Let me tell you 'bout the fire.
You could bring the waters up above.
I'll bring my favorite people and I'm bringing all my love.
You want a battle well don't look very far,
You want to fight somebody come fight the superstar.
I knew you wouldn't stand a chance you left without a passing glance,
There's nothing you could ever do to keep me from stopping you

It's so dark and lonely out here in outer space,
But at least I got my keyboard and my low bot has his bass.
Playing street sweeper tunes and watching TIE fighters fly by.
Things would be better if I was back at home with Pepper
Burning pakalolo not even noticing the weather
So far and so alone a million light years away.
Storm trooper storm trooper back up from my door
I got my blaster set I'm ready to start a minor war.
This won't be the day you were hoping for so just walk away walk away.
Better run now cause your done now cause your standing in a bad man's town, boy.
Time to get back to my daily routine have a beer at a bar on Tattooine.

You take away everything, make my people scream out loud.
Just bring it back
Lord just bring it back.
You mess it up and you rearrange open your eyes and turn the page.
Just bring it back.

I believe I'll interject to talk about the word respect.
It's not a word that's in your hands
Its more about the common man
You took your time and paved the way
Making room for other man to play a
Grip of bodies a mess of minds endless conversations to rock."

And I dream I'm on vacation
'Cause I like the way that sounds
It's a perfect occupation
For me
I don't mind being by myself
If there's no one else around
It's the last good time in town

Well, I could stand up straight, get a real job
Stay up late with the same old mob
But it hasn't crossed my mind
Lately

Put on a suit, work downtown
Then come up when the sun goes down
No, I haven't had the time
Lately

Lately I've been stayin' at home

Closin' the curtains, play jazz on trombone

On regardait hagards, ils sont fous, on pleurait de chagrin
Alors que des p√©tards explosaient dans les rues
Leur f√™te insupportable et puis leurs feux de joie
Nous partions t√™tes basses dig√©rer notre nuit, 
Vomir notre d√©go√ªt

Et d√©ja de partout bien rang√©s courraient les policiers
Leur petit chef debout au balcon de la honte
Et le peuple √† sa botte
Lui remettait les cl√©s, la m√©moire est bien courte
Notre France est aux fers
Tous les Denis Robert n'ont qu'√† bien se tenir, 
N'ont qu'√† bien se tenir

Il pouvait maintenant √† sa guise √©gorger la libert√©
La main-mise sur tout, le grand marionnettiste
Des journaux, des t√©l√©s
En regardant le port s'√©loigner dans le noir
J'ai serr√© fort mon fils, si triste de me voir si triste
Mais dans mes yeux je sais il a bien lu mon coeur

R√©sistance, r√©sistance, r√©sistance

Tout autour tout ces feux tous ces points de lumi√®re
Ces milliers de bateaux
Je connais ce signal c'est celui de nos fr√®res
Hissons haut le drapeau
Main dans la main nous allons revenir
L'heure n'est plus aux pleurs il faut organiser le venir
Et dans ces heures sombres repense √† Charletty,
Repense √† la lumi√®re
A tous ces coeurs lanc√©s ce murmure qui gronde,
Ne s'arr√™tera plus
Dans ce nouveau maquis ne pas suivre √† genoux
Ne jamais se soumettre et toujours r√©sister droit debout,
Droit debout

It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one
Thinking about everything we become
And I hate it
I thought we could make it

But I'm ready to dead this
Just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures
And the letters she sent

You had me thinking
You were out with your friends
I'm so foolish
Play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I

Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again

'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why
But this is what you say

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

Visions in my mind
Of the day that we met
You showed me things
That I'll never forget

Took me swimming
In the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating
You think I'm playing

When you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses
And my loving
But ain't nobody better than us

Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again
'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

I guess it's over indefinitely
But you and I know
It's not that easy to let go
Of everything that we planned
And start all over again

Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won't forget how you do it
Sweet baby this is where the game ends now
Somehow wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

You finna make me say boy
I wish that you come hold me
When I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to

You would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(When we ride we ride, it's till the day we die)
Boy you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say
(When we ride we ride, it's till the day we die)

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride

Before you drift to sleep upon your cot
Think back on all the tales that you remember
Of Camelot

Ask ev'ry person if he's heard the story
And tell it strong and clear if he has not
That once there was a fleeting wisp of glory
Called Camelot

Camelot, Camelot
Now say it out with pride and joy
Camelot, Camelot

Yes, Camelot, my boy
Where once it never rained till after sundown
By 8 a.m the morning fog had flown
Don't let it be forgot that once there was a spot
For one brief shining moment that was known
As Camelot"

It's so unfair but so clear
Don't none of them represent me
And ain't one of them represent my peers
And it don't matter who we vote for, nor who gets in
The poor keep dying and the rich keep living
Mothers keep losing their children to the system
They stay strong while we remain victims
Telling us to hope for higher things
Educate yourself ain't that how y'all say it
But they keep increasing the fee
Knowing full well that we can't pay it
And did you stop and listen before you started dishing
Our tax for ammunition to kill innocent children
When right in front of you we can't cope
We hungry, homeless, unemployed and broke
Were dying, the health service is a joke
You said things would change when you wanted our votes

But it stays the same
Mr. Prime Minister
And we continue to die
Mr. Prime Minister
Not a damn thing changed
Mr. Prime Minister
Nobody hears our cries

When my life's a threat
They tell me run go call police
But yet who's gonna protect me from the beasts
They ain't got my interest at heart
They ain't my friends
Ain't got a enemy alive as evil as the system
So much corruption and this gun shit wont end
And all they sit and f***ing do is blame 50 Cent
Please, now take responsibility
Who's putting them runs on our streets
And who's pumping drugs into our community
Controlling the propaganda on my TV
And who's molding our children's ideologies
And taking away their opportunity
Were killing each other so we can live above our means
'Cause what we earn can't even buy a fraction of our dreams
And wonder why so many have become fiends
It's so hard to live poor and keep your hands clean
So I am keeping mind together
And pray that god forgives my sins
Its real hard living the life were living"

209,TRAXDBM128E0785BD8.h5,Missy Higgins,The Special Two (Australian Version),"I've hardly been outside my room in days,
'Cause I don't feel that I deserve the sunshine's rays.
The darkness helped until the whiskey wore away,
And it was then I realized that conscience never fades.
When you're young you have this image of your life:
That you'll be scrupulous and one day even make a wife.
And you make boundaries you'd never dream to cross,
And if you happen to you wake completely lost.
But I will fight for you, be sure that
I will fight until we're the special two once again.

And we will only need each other, we'll bleed together,
Our hands will not be taught to hold another's,
'Cause we're the special two.
And we could only see each other, we'll breathe together,
These arms will not be taught to need another's,
'Cause we're the special two.

I remember someone old once said to me:
That lies will lock you up with truth the only key
But I was comfortable and warm inside my shell,
And couldn't see this place could soon become my hell.
So is it better to tell and hurt or lie to save their face?
Well I guess the answer is don't do it in the first place.
I know I'm not deserving of your trust from you right now,
But if by chance you change your mind you know I will not
Let you down 'cause we were the special two, and will be again.

And we will only need each other, we'll bleed together,
Our hands would not be taught to hold another's,
'Cause we're the special two.
And we could only see each other we'll breathe together,
These arms will not be taught to need another's
'Cause we're the special two.

I step outside my mind's eyes for a minute.
And I look over me like a doctor looking for disease,
Or something that could ease the pain.
But nothing cures the hurt you bring on by yourself,
Just remembering, just remembering how we were

And we would only need each other, we'd bleed together,
These hands would not be taught to hold another's,
We were the special two.
And we could only see each other we'd bleed together,
These arms would not be taught to need another's
'Cause we're the special two."

Yeah Yeah
Kamachi, Planetary, King Syze

(Chief Kamachi)
Yo, they love the way I pin a champ,
Under a tinted lamp hear my voice blast from a vintage amp.
I kill the reciters of lies,
Get burned by the fire from the light in my eyes.
It's Kamachi, possessed by the pharaoh ways,
Underground like where the dead bone marrow stays.
The spot where you breath is where the arrow lays,
A sideways death for a narrow grave.
My shit hit hard like an Arab raid.
We blow up, ain't no need for a barricade.
They looking for good luck, like a barrel of jade,
They looking, so stuffed when the barrel is sprayed.
Since the five perfect exertions, they waited afraid.
The devil caught from the tower on the table is slayed, pussy.

Fall back, fold up, rappers is so tough,
Until the army roll up banging that cold crush.
We send shots through ya vest and leave your soul touched,
Lock and load up, post up, toast up.

(King Syze)
Aiyo, my vocal duel, payments hiatus save the local crews.
Only the chosen few can ride with the most explosive crew.
But not you, jealous ones they envy us,
'Cause we spit venomous, until books remember us.
Hell fire embedded in us, plus sins condemning us,
It's just what I write, ignite cop killers and predators.
I be like this, best believe I can't be ignored,
Spitting metaphoric, until the chosen child is aborted.
When my mind's in orbit, forces knock you out your high horses.
Deal with high sources, until the meal is five courses.
The flames is high, when my brain and the train collide.
Under much needed change in time, the game is mine.
Build strength through the niggas that be hating me peers,
But it's the army, part of me y'all been waiting for years.
From a small block, hip hop, busting my tool.
King Syze, dope shit, what can I say man? It's nothing new.

Fall back, fold up, rappers are so tough,
Until the army roll up banging that cold crush.
We send shots through ya vest and leave your soul touched,
Lock and load up, post up, toast up.

(Planetary)
I'm a scientist in the lab, with a violent twist and a gift of gab,
Pharaoh tongue that can lash through your clique and stab.
From the days where you carried screw drivers,
In back pockets in case you had to prove that your crew lava.
We was painting on your property,
And until this day I still got rookie niggas out trying to copy me.
Planetary nigga, Q-D original,
Smooth criminal, bash your mental, bruise your physical.
There's something about the evilness of this track,
It makes the heaven's gates close, and the tabernacles crack.
In fact, it separates all the lies and the facts,
It makes you see the light right before the sky turns black.
It turns boys to men, it turns toy soldiers to generals,
Innocent mother fuckers graduate to criminals.
It makes you think twice about who you are,
It makes you feel like death's coming every 16 bars.


Fall back, fold up, rappers is so tough,
Until the army roll up banging that cold crush.
We send shots through ya vest and leave your soul touched,
Lock and load up, post up, toast up."

Cross my heart and hope to die, shall I cause another tear from your eye?

With the sound, grab my bozack then I freeze now...

With the flow to jet like Delta, or Jesse O.
Whiz with the bends I clean my front lens
With a system, that knocks harder than Rin-Tin-Tin

Wicked when I Kick It like A Tribe Called Quest-in

Then split ya from your wrist to your armpits

To fading memory

As summer gave it's life away to autumn
A promise made fulfilled on his return
A six month job with a privateer
Knowing it'll make him rich to give
All that she deserves

The farmers warned of nasty weather
The worst in many years
The winter took away her love and now
She's alone with her tears

The winter slowly passed away to spring
She spends her days out waiting on the pier
Spring turned into summer
And she realized he wasn't coming home
On a warm summer's day she went alone
Blinded by her grief she said goodbye to the sun
Up upon the widow's walk they saw her fall into the bay
A fading memory

The farmers warned of nasty weather
The worst in many years
The winter took away her love 
But now there's no more tears
She brought herself back to his arms
Within a watery grave
And now they spend eternity together
Lost within the waves"

All right I might
Have had a little glare when I stared at ya ho
But I didn't know she was like that
She stared right back
My niggas warnin me that she was comin' on to me
I react like a mack do I act cool
Just to test her 'cause I ain't no jester
I suggest her and her friend be outtie
'Cause I don't want to make my pals get rowdy
And doubt me our friendship
But when lips touch
I go crazy in the clutch
Sorta like schitzo I forgets my bros and pals over gals
I didn't mean to but when you fiend you do
Strange things for the denim no matter who's in em
Grab a flooze then I'm in traffic
Don't laugh it might be your girl that I'm talkin' about
I didn't mean to

It ain't my fault that your girl got caught
It ain't my fault that your girl got caught (I didn't mean to)

Another incident when I went
Way beyond what I should have done
John should of stopped before them drawers dropped
But I didn't ain't no quittin
Really didn't care who's girl I was hittin
I admit skinz ain't a reason to lose friends
But then again I didn't know, sorry
Accept apologies and live on
Are we goin' hold grudges well oh fudge
It's a new year and I do fear
Ya actions ya actin' shy
I mean ya need to be smackin
That hoe
Instead of tryin' to front on me ya know
That's exactly how I'm goin' to be ya know
I run my game on any G ya know
'Cause we the most entertainin
I meant to blame women
For makin' me do what the Ak seem to
When you call I screen you
I didn't mean to


Verse Three:

Why do fools be schememin dreamin'
Actin' like demons
Niggas don't give a fuck
Because they beat shit
To many girls front cute
When they want loot
They tell lies the swell guys
Can peep it and that's weak shit
That's why I run game on every freak I get
Born in Oakland grew up pumpin Too Short
I know the rules on the flooze so who's short
I once had a ho who smoked blunts yo
She tried to get me so I looked at the front door
And now she's not with me so forget it
But every once in a while I'll hit it
And it happened to be your girl

Go find your fortune fast, its cold outside but you'll make it

Now on Arabian Spruce, Seagram's bumpy and juice
We used to bag and then truce, we used to sag and get loose
Not the kind of cats that's out to steal your bag and your jewels
But we check your medication just to see if you cool
You can't be dyin' on us, after you live off of hemp
We party hard, like Ludacris Kim and Shock and them
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hen be
And hemp be the beats we flip thee and we pimps thee simply

(Ludacris)
So stay with me, and let's get tipsy
Rememberin the days on the block sippin whiskey
Runnin' 'round grinnin, runnin' 'round sinnin
Gettin' lit, then I wonder why my head kept spinnin
But I'm all grown up now, less throwin' up now
Record blowed up, so my hood throwed up
Now let's break loose cause your boy's around
And tonight we gon' celebrate bein alive, riiiiight

(Ludacris)
It's just one of those days, without a care in the world
You ain't gotta look mean, I know you care for your girl
But she's lookin' this way and I'm gonna come get her
Fresh haircut, so I'm feelin' quite kipper
Can't nothin' go wrong cause my strap's on my back
And if fools wanna scrap then my tool will attack
But forget the click-clack, ain't no need for the steel
Just a straight house party and some meat on the grill

(DJ Quik)
Now if it's Los Angeles, watch a boss handle biz
I'ma put this on my kids, stupid it's an outfit
If you ain't been around the world keep yo' mouth zipped
Or you'll be wonderin where yo' house went
You see I'm not normal and I'm not a homo
I'm mo' apt to shoot a porno with you in cornrows
And call it ""More Hoes: Volume 5, Volume 6""
And show 'em in the back of my truck, at the FreakNic
Trick, what'chu workin with?

You're wrong to me and now I see
I'm not that bitch you want me to be

It's not too late, to turn the hate
Into a chance to get into my way
You can waste your breath
But you're my past
It's certain that I leave

Now I start to wipe the slate clean
'Cause I got my own head, got my own feet
I'm not worry about anything
It's time to make my deal

Now I'm going my own way
I can go for much better days
Than with you my dear
Now I'm back in my life again
I begin to forget the end it's me now and here

I got some dimes
Don't need a crime
I got a goal fixed on my mind
A new best friend, who understands
The way I'm talking, the way I am

I don't feel the pain
It's not the same
Like anytime you gave me blame
It's my turn to play
My own game
Man I'm feeling free

Now I'm going my own way
I can go for much better days
Than with you my dear
So now I'm back in my life again
I begin to forget the end it's me now and here

I don't know why it took me so long...
So many reasons that you gave me
To walk off with bad memories
So now it's easy, it's easy,
It's easy, it's easy...

Now I'm going my own way
I can go for much better days
Than with you my dear
So now I'm back in my life again
I begin to forget the end it's me now and here

Now I'm going my own way
I can go for much better days

If only just to see

And everything comes alive

Survived without you
Bringing out the kid in me
Now I'm resigned to say

Only you
You and only you
You and only you
Can take this heart
And make it new
You and only you

I try
To make something of my day
But I hopelessly drift away
To the place where
We can be alone again
I'll never be the same again
All because of

You never, heard of a mind as perverted as mine
You better get rid of that nine, it ain't gonna help
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?

I'm waiting for hell like hell shit I'm anxious as Hell
Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen I was putting shells in a gauge on a shelf

I used to get punked and bullied on my block
Till I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox
{""Mom! MOM!""} I used to give a - fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of success?  It sucks, too much press I'm stressed

Too much cess and breasts, too upset
It's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick (yes)
Grew up quick (no) was raised right
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say is right

You think of my name now whenever you say, ""Hi""
Became a commodity because I'm W-H-I-T-E 
'Cause MTV was so friendly to me can't wait 'til Kim sees me

just to see if he's influenced by me if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit he's an innocent victim
and becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe

I been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational {""Back is the incredible!""}
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff on the internet
Trying to lure your kids with him into bed

It's a sick world we live in these days
""Slim for Pete's sakes put down Christopher Reeve's legs!""
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
""Slim it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it""

Mind with no sense in it, fried to get schizophrenic
whose eyes get so squinted, I'm blind from smoking 'em
With my windows tinted, with nine limos rented
Doing lines of coke in 'em with a bunch of guys hopping out
all high and indo scented {*inhales, exhales*}

I take seven kids from Columbine, stand 'em all in line
Add an AK-47, a revolver, a nine
A Mack-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
and that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time

Cause (I'mmmm) Shady, they call me as crazy
as the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way, *NSYNC, why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?

Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think?
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
Cause all these fans screaming is making my ears ring (AHHHH!!!)

So I just, throw up a middle finger and let it linger
longer than the rumor that I was sticking it to Christina
'Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez and Puffy you know this!

I'm sorry Puff, but I don't give a fuck if this chick was my own mother
I still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her
And have a son and a new brother at the same time
And just say that it ain't mine, what's my name?

As day dragged into day
The doctors gave no hope for her
She seemed to fade away

My hours were filled with constant dread
Time became a knife
Slowly and relentlessly
Cut the cord of life

There was a Teacher in the region then
Some of us had heard
He'd healed the paralytic
By the power of just His word

So if the hope became rekindled
I went at once to see
If I could find a man named Jesus
From a town called Galilee

I began to search the city
And soon I saw the crowd
They were pressing in to touch Him
And they called His name out loud

But with the strength of desperation
I pushed them all aside
I threw myself before Him
And from my knees I cried

Lord, come and heal my daughter
Even now she's close to death
Her fever's uncontrolable
She fights for every breath

But God's given you the power
Life is yours to give
If You'll just lay Your hands on her
I know that she will live, she will live, she will live

Well, He just began to walk with me
When a face I saw with fear
Came towards me with the news
I knew I didn't wanna hear

And although I tried still myself
I trembled when he said
Don't bother the teacher anymore
Your little girl is dead

And then Jesus touched my shoulder
And told me not to grieve
The trembling stopped when He looked at me
And said only believe

And then He sent the crowds away
Except His closest men
And they followed right behind us
As we started off again

We were still a long ways down the road
When I heard the sounds and cries
Of the mourners and musicians
As they strove to dramatize

My grief, they had no business with
Beneath their loud disguise
My wife just sat there silently
And stared through empty eyes

Then Jesus asked the mourners
Why is it that you weep?
She isn't dead as you suppose
The child is just asleep

It only took a moment
For their wails to turn to jeers
Who does this Man think He is?
Get Him outta here

With authority I've never heard
In the lips of any man
He spoke and every sound rolled out
With a thunder of command

And in the sudden silence
They all hurried for the door
Wondering what the reasons were
They'd ever come there for

Then He called His three disciples
That were with Him on the way
He led them and my wife and me
To where our daughter lay

He took her by the hand
He told her, child arise
And the words were barely spoken
When she opened up her eyes

She rose and walked across the room
And stood there at our sides
My wife knelt down and held her close
And at last she really cried

Then Jesus told us both to see
Our daughter had some food
And as to how her life was saved
Not to speak a word, not to speak a word

I got to tell somebody
I got to tell somebody
I got to tell somebody
I got to tell somebody
I got to tell somebody
I got to tell somebody, got to tell somebody
What Jesus did for me

I got to tell somebody
Got to tell somebody
What Jesus did for me
I got to tell somebdoy
Got to tell somebdoy
What Jesus did for me
I got to tell somebody
Got to tell somebody
What Jesus did for me

I got to tell somebody
I got to tell somebody
I got to tell somebody
What Jesus did, What Jesus did for me
I got to tell somebody
I got to tell somebody
I got to tell somebody
What Jesus did, What Jesus did for me

Ya know He gave me life
When my hope was dead
When there was grief
He brought joy instead

Got to tell somebody
What Jesus did for me
I got to tell somebody
Got to tell somebody
I got to tell somebody
What Jesus did for me
I got to tell somebody
What Jesus did
I got to tell somebody
What Jesus did

T.J. and Charley had a little bar band
They played covers every Friday night
Bonnie was a waitress and a big fan
And every break the three of them would
Take a drink and talk about life
When it came to love, money or fame
Charley's philosophy was always the same.

It ain't how good you are
It's how bad you want it
It ain't how good you are
It's how bad you want it.

Well, Charley loaded his old Impala
T.J. said, ""I think I'm gonna stay
When you hit it big there, give us a holler.""
And as the dust settled back down
Bonnie turned and asked T.J.
""Why don't you go, you're good enough to try?""
T.J. said, ""Bonnie, Charley was right.""

It ain't how good you are
It's how bad you want it
(Do you want it)
It ain't how good you are
It's how bad you want it, how bad.

Well, Charley got to tour with Lynyrd Skynyrd
And when his silver bus came rollin' through
Well, Bonnie made 'em all a fried chicken dinner
And when she left to get them pie
Charley said, ""I loved her too
How did she end up with you instead?""
T.J. said ""Charley, it's just like you said.""

It ain't how good you are
It's how bad you want it
(Do you want it)
Yeah, it ain't how good you are
It's how bad you want it, do you want it.

Cantaloupe thumps like it's finally ripe
Box fan on a lawn chair suckin' in swamp air
That's what country is

It ain't a rebel flag you bought at the mall
It's a hide away bed in an old horse stall
Two kids gettin' caught stealin' a Boone's farm kiss
It ain't a John Deere cap that's never fell in the cotton
It's a Jimmy Rodgers song that was long forgotten
It's homemade peach ice cream on sunburnt lips
That's what country is

When the sun starts slippin' from the delta sky
And the last scarecrow tucks in for the night
Make a fire throw a blanket on the sandy bank
'Bout an hour till we feel the first catfish yank
Barefoot cane pole wavin' at the riverboats
They when they're gone take a dip in the moon glow
That's what country is

It ain't a jacked up truck that's never seen a pasture
It's cars pulling over for a no cab tractor
It's homemade peach ice cream on sunburnt lips
No, it can't be bought it's somethin' you're born with"

And I'm on

With a flame
Feel the fire
Desire the same
Knowledge and wisdom
And understanding
Possessed by gods
Transferred to man in
A script of a book
A scripture that looks
Like a Biblical writing
Inviting a hook
Of a song sing along with a strong
Subliminal
Message divesting all men from
Criminal
Acts of the Devil
Revealed and reveled
Designed to recline the mind to lower level
With no spiritual level
Read the Holy Koran
Or the Bible
Because it's liable
To be a revival
For the weak who seek power it'll bring
Infallible power
Knowledge is king
Knowledge
Who wants some
Come get it
A battle is a test of wits
And I'm witted
Hard beats a torch
And I lit it
Stop the music
All right hit it
Now that it feels good
I'm heating up
I feed off knowledge
And can't get enough
Knowledge is infinite
Suckers ain't into it
Ignorance is bliss
And they're kin to it
Party and dance
And don't ever glance
At a book or look
For their mind to advance
Caught in a rut
Chasing butt
Trying to get a dollar
Or trying to get a nut
Evil feeds
Off a source of apathy
Weak in the mind

Less than a man
More like a thing
No knowledge you're nothin'

A meak mind anorexic
You can't hang without slang
So eject it
I've selected
Rhymes for records
To affect the effect
Of the rhyme that left
Hangin' like a pound
That came down
But you're hangin' the brain
So your brain's hell-bound
Lost and found
By the serpent's sound
What you don't know
Can't hurt that's profound
Or absurd
A better word
An ingnorant fool
Is a real cool nerd
Pockets are fat
With an empty head
Got a little fame and a name
And you're brain dead
You count dollars
So ya think ya in
What good is knowing how to count
If you don't know when
And history today
And it will equal the future
Repetitive mistakes
Cause the brain ain't acute ya
Need knowledge
To understand
The concept of sacrifice
But man don't understand
So we have to fight
War
Killing people we never
Saw before
Most don't eden know
What they're killin' for
Following rulers
Instead of the prophets
The wicked can rule ya
But the knowledge can stop it
Souls can't be controlled
It's a spiritual thing
But you got the knowledge
Knowledge is king
Knowledge
My knowledge comes
From a spiritual force
Stonger than any
Earthly source
Propaganda
Hype or slander
I won't believe the hype
I understand the
Media dictates
The mind and rotates
The way you think
And syncopates slow pace
Brains
Can't maintain
Acertain
Insipid inane crass rain
Insane lame
Traditions
All praise fame
Positions
Want to be a star
Drive a big car
Live bourgeios
Ane won't know who you are
Lost in the source
And praising the dollar
Whether your faith is
Christ or Allah
The knowledge of God
Will teach one thing
The dollar is moot

They offer no relief

There is a secret I keep
It's called the talking leaf

That he speaks his beliefs
Like a rock that bleeds
A sea of grief
My talking leaf speaks of
A wounded knee creek

He walks the streets of life
But he's in chains
I'm alive he cried
I can feel the flame
Burning red inside
I am an Indian brave

That lives in my blood
Of the brand you laid
On all you touched
But the burning flame
Turns to burning pain

And that's truly insane
So like a wild hurricane
I will dance on the grave
Of my race that died
When it should have been saved

Acting like an eighth-grader
I should have my face lasered

I was putting a wad of genetic material
Into every other jelly bag
When you exit wasted
Pirouetting on the helipad
The sound of bank mergers for the underpaid workers
And the frankfurters in deadly hands
So her tentacles look just like a purple mollusk
My dissension is imminent and parabolic
Many of the sexes are fixed in prelims
Dimples with candy tips and a landing strip
And like an X-Mas tree trimmed
And I'm serving a person burger speaking against a third term
With my parasol ripped
Look at those meaty thighs - must be CGI'd
Who else goes to career day with a ""B"" word seismographed
With a marshmallow suit made of fiberglass
And a nametag saying ""No one should ask""
A token black typecast in my (?)
I should probably set up a resized JPEG
Of my Wienerschnitzel hut, instead
I sell her an ad for a defried page head
Now I'm too fickle, my heart's peanut brittle
And if it don't amount to the findings in the Concord
I should be spiking the punch bowl
To make these hussies more cooperative
Her name is (name is, name is, name name name name name...)

Ellen Disingenuous
She's of the best ilk
Her sexy breast milk's
So good
It's so strenuous
To make Neo-feminism palatable

Ellen Disingenuous
She's screen-tested
So you know
You see her pink flesh delving the void
It's so strenuous
To make her grand bisexuality work

For every uncle with a Terabithia jaunt
When I wear my trivial ankh
To chaperone your lovely Milk Duds
My credit build-ups
Our committee is swamped
And the druggie's pill cup
But I lunge at her with a sponge loofah
And a cannon-powered (?) bazooka
You're an incubator built for a young pupa
But I mishandled the money shot
It's tantric and pampered
A big (?) at your scrunchy spa
You're a man-eater
When you get to nibble on your bloody spot
Turn on my lights into a telenovela
I'm a helluva fella
With a profile (?) like (?) uranium

What's your name again
What's your name again
What's your name...

I've had my fill
Of the (?) with the bone density of (?)
Full-bodied chicken strips
I am like ""tsk tsk.""
I could paint a strip

In a seafood stew
And be (?)

My figurative outline issued their induced labor

But her respect's ballin'

And it's more fun doing wrong""

""The ladies call me lover 'cause I got the gift of gab
And a few other specialties

This is the way
That you Choose
To build your false utopia
This is the way
I choose
To build my false rebellion
For god and country
What happened to
For life and humanity

I'm not a sheep
I will not be
Led to the slaughter
You can only do so much
On your knees
With your eyes sewn shut
Stand up and take a true look
A true look at the hell
That we've all created

All Created

Unlearn

This has gone on
For too long
We've let our senses be numbed
Only fucking one way
To Reverse
Your Creation
It must be unwritten"

Let them not depart from thy eyes
Keep them in the midst of thy heart
For they are life unto those that find them and health within all their flesh
Put away from thee a forward mouth and greet thine perverse lips

""I am the only God, worship me""

My sons, attend unto my wisdom and bow thine ear to my understanding
That thou mayest regard discretion and thy lips may keep knowledge as you know how to learn and keep silence

Hear me now therefore o ye children and depart not from my mouth
Come not nigh the door of my house if facility gives thee honour unto others

Incline thyself unto cruelty and walk the flesh which is consumed
Drink waters out of their cistern and let their rivers flows unto thy streets
Then thou may not regard my discretion and thy lips may not keep thy knowledge

You didn't know who would have control

Where it took seconds to shape fortunes
Your pains it weighed down hell
Spilling blood to cleanse the memories
That you know made you so frail

Empty eyes look through the barrel, sweating fingers on the gun
One push off the threshold to target sympathies
Just a broken statue and the world remains unchanged
So close and still no place where anything would end

Trapped between blooded walls
And the fight was there today
Fists breaking against the concrete
None to forgive no strength to run

How could it be how would it end?
When you wake up you wish them to cry
Fragments of this being fragments of its meaning to burn away

Suffocating in the grasp of this hate
Driven to fire your last round
Escape from the air and drown under the earth
Dead mirror by the wayside, nowhere to turn

An empty shell buried to the ground
Prepare yourself to forfait
Another saviour just another failure
Where bleak winds grind the surface

Fear and regret stain dim recollections
An act of rash solutions
Last one there, the broken statue
Built with hands that are bleeding

Empty eyes look through the shattered image
And their pain it weighs down hell
Spilling blood to cleanse the memories
That you know make you so frail

How could it be how would it end?
When you wake up they are holding your time
Fragments of this being fragments of its meaning"

Careless needle.

And lives are broken.

Forceful ageing,
Help me I'm fading.

It's time to move on.

Crossing that bridge,
With lessons I've learned.
Playing with fire,
And not getting burned.
I may not know what you're going through.
But time is the space,
Between me and you.
Life carries on... it goes on.

Just say die,
And that would be pessimistic.
In your mind,
We can walk across the water.
Please don't cry,
It's just a prayer for the dying.
I just don't know what's got into me.

Been crossin' that bridge,
With lessons I've learned.
...Learned...

Playing with fire,
And not getting burned.
...Burned burned...

I may not know what you're going through,
But time is the space,
Between me and you.

Along came a train and it took her life away,
Now kitty is cryin'. I think I'll take him home.
But that would mean dead girl would be out here all alone.
Oh, boy, it's gettin' late.
Should I ask her on a date?
Maybe this time I will get it right...

'Cause you can't break a dead (no!)
Can't break a dead (no!)

Who will remember all of the things, the things we have forgotten? Who will right the things, the things that we've done wrong? Who will the hearts of those who hurt? Who will be His hands? Who will go?

I'll stay late with D.J. Sass until the next day
Fuck Key Largo take me back to the X-Ray

Take me back to the X-Ray

My fingers are frozen my coat is soaked through
My toes are past numb we've got a hundred more to do
They're only getting wetter got to get another up
Luke loads the stapler then he slaps the hammer shut

Tack tack tack down the right then the left side
If you see Five-O then you'd better step hide
Wait until they pass and come around the block again
Time to go back to work before this late night ends

Over on my left he's holding up another poster
Pushing up the corner as the staple falls close to
His index finger as his breath lingers in the air
Water trickles up his arm he doesn't seem to care

He doesn't wear gloves they make it hard to grab the paper
On a late night caper with a state of the art stapler
Damn it's getting cold but still we've got to pass the word
Plastering the poles from Hawthorne to twenty third

But not in front of Fred's or Crocodile they'll tear them down
And never cover the X-Ray's 'cause they support the sound
Luke will tack it back if it belongs to a friend
But if you cover his you'll never see your shit again so watch your

Posters...

Here we go again after the show again I've got to hit the
Streets work my feet and get my flow again
All alone and then I feel the pavement on my aching feet
Dawn will come before this trip's complete

Concrete and light rain stain the city I was born in
I hardly feel alive as the horizon whispers morning
Walking on train tracks from halls where the name's at
I wanted to clear my head but once again all of the pain's back

I'm torn between the place I'm in and where I want to be
Faith won't wait kid so what's it gonna be
Forget it and let it go take no as the answer
Or if you choose to do it better get serious as cancer

But see I took a peek and looked deep into it
And after what I saw I'm not so sure I should pursue it
Still I know a half-step is likely to be my last step
And playing live beats nine to fives so thrive or hit the casket"

Apparently, he went _Kamikaze_. The big question is,
Will the rapper survive?\""

Now it was a war it was like I was in Vietnam
But I kill 'em all, cause _Kamikaze_ was the bomb
Got a strap to my back and I ran in if I was a terrorist
Got 'em all scanned at this President's head everybody be calm
Die for my belief, but got out the rubbish because it
This cup of death, Death was not yet meant for me to drink from it
Thinkin' how could I ever survive, I knew I was ready to ride
I even had C4 duct taped to my stomach but uh
(You got a right to survive)
But you gotta have will and always be ready to come off the wall
They gon' be willin' to test you and catch you if you talk the talk
But I'ma keep on with the struggle fuck leavin' my body in chalk
(You're gonna make it)
Look at me now 'cause I'm standin on top of the globe (say what)
Makin' big money for spittin' my popular flow (say what)
Now look at the swagger of a platinum veteran servin' 'em medicine
It's not a given to work 'cause I'm choppin them O's
Can't fuck with the swagger the haters just look at me nigh
I'm stickin them daggers in haters just look at them cry
The shit don't affact us effect us they wanna imagine
They take us lay 'em on the back, I'm makin' 'em look at the sky
If I think they cool, I give 'em a dutch
If they break the rules, I give 'em a crutch
If they on the come up and I feel 'em I give 'em some dust
If they talkin' shit I'ma bust at 'em and get 'em to hush
Get away clean, go high on the meter, I got the streetsweeper
A creeper believe I get deep as the word of a preacher (and I)
Lyrical retriever but good with them heaters
When I'm full of passion and fury like when you listen to Syleena (and I)
Went multi-platinum when I stepped on enemy grounds
Now bodies all over the world is fin' to be found
And _Kamikaze_ was successful now c'mon and feel _The Day After_

She's so afraid of pain
So afraid of blame
It's driving her insane
So insecure
There is no cure

She's so afraid, afraid of life

Getting louder all the time

His army coat keeps out the cold

In May last year
The poor fellows broken-hearted
From his moustache hang the tears,
Now all his life is souvenirs

A [worn book ?) on his knees, a fire, some sleep
The doctor looked at him to find
There's nothing physical
It's in, his mind
Ah ah ah

He's only pleasure now is,
A little photograph,
Of his army wedding
Those medals on his uniform,
Now [buy/by] the wood to keep him warm

To the church down in the lane

Ya Dig!

The story starts off, lil boy black in the ghetto
No matter what he does it's back to the ghetto (ghetto)
No choice but to adapt to the ghetto
So he adapts the ghetto
Yes, the crack and the metal
He took no days off, for gettin' this cocaine off
He ran back and forth so much it pissed Jose off
Now Jose was the cocaine boss
Straight from Columbia, his cocaine soft
But Jose was out fuckin' his sister
Hittin shorty off 'cause he had love for his sister
And shorty had no love for his sister 'cause sister would sniff up everything Jose gives her
But shorty had a plan for them both
'Cause he was good at handlin coke so Jose liked 'em Problem was, he was pitchin for the dudes down the street
You know, Cj, Big Boo, and Meleke
Meleke was a killa, Boo was a killa
Cj, well he's just anotha nigga
Despite the fact, they didn't like the fact, that he was close to Jose and he might just rat
And bein that he was a bitch and he ain't know when its here
They set it up to get him there 'n' hit him there
But shorty was smart, so before they got to load up 'n' spark he said hold up my heart
Please, then he said Please, look up in my bag, there's cook up in my bag
It's all good up in my bag
And there's more where that came from
It came from Jose, believe me there's more where that caine from
He had 'em lost and the game won 
They let him go thinkin' he would let 'em know where Jose was keepin' the heavy coke
But instead he told Jose bout that
And we all know Jose bout that
Next thing we know we see Jose slouch back
In the chair like it's no way out that
He said shoot 'em ima blow they house back
Next day Jose sent the 2-way out town
And somebody blew they house down
Jose think shorty on his side
But he don't know shorty on his side
So shorty called Jose, like listen, it's going down I need more cocaine
So they met up, it was a set up
Guess who? Cj, Meleke and Boo speed up
You shoulda seen the look on Jose's face
You neva seen a look on no man's face
Told him no man's great, and it's no man's place
To fuck with no man's fam
Then he said where's my sister before I kill you
The End

The story's over man (over man)
They all kinda end like that man, ya dig
You see, I told this story because I kinda feel like, every hood, everybody, everybody gotta lil boy fresh and them somewhere
Weither it's right next door, across the hall
Up the block, down the block, around the corner
I mean, you see, you see we all see the same shit, just through diffent eyes

There's too much money,
We all got a price,
But when the ugliness burns
It lights up the sky.

Two-faced illegalizer.

The prison walls
Are splittin' their seams
While booze and tobacco
Advertise in 'zines.

The capital's doctored
At the ""Cleanse and Loan"" -
If their clients default
Guess who gets boned?

Janus, the ""Victimizer"",
You two-faced illegalizer.
What you hold dear
Is fear.

Oh yeah, oh no,
Oh yeah, oh no

Once in a while,
To let the big fish fry
They send the prices
Soaring way up high

Victimizer.

Two-faced illegalizer.

Got burnt by women poor dirts? In Venice
Landlords and tenants, got served by creditors

No benefits plan, wrote a letter to my senator

Chant sweet melodies, utter hymns and sing praise to his name

Performing mighty deeds and making new things,
Sowing righteousness and creating healing

Sometimes love can be so nice
A gamble, just like throwin' the dice
Lose once and then lose twice

But still I'm hoping inside
Jump off then my bend of wide
Somewhere, don't get anywhere
Just get me the hell out of here

Pain you brought in my heart
Ask myself why did I start
This thing, that keeps me daily changing
And driving me crazy

Sometimes I want to step back
But it's still damn hard to do that
No matter what you do
All I want is you

No matter where you're going to, babe
No matter what you let me know

And success the dreams we're chasing
'Cause we need to sit down, stop for a play around
Find a place to a homelier headtown

Get my brainstorm, bring your things on
Practice love is the idea of born
Peace is what you say to me
All the time you try betraying me

Hope one day you'll stop and we'll see
Yo, that's not the way be
Living a life of blaster won't last her
Look at the world, a disaster

Ever put your hands together
Try to live together, we can never

I had a dream that you were with me
It wasn't my fault
You rolled me over, flipped me over
Like a somersault.
That doesn't happen to me
I've never been here before
But I saw forever in my never
And I stood outside her heaven

Will you wait for me in time?
It's never my luck so never mind
I've lost a lot of what I don't expect to ever return
I tend to push them till the pushing's turned from hurt into burn
I always take them to that place they thought they wanted to go
Then end up dancing round, this clown commands applause at his show

I had a dream that you were with me
It wasn't my fault
You rolled me over, flipped me over
A somersault
That doesn't happen to me
I've never been here before
I saw forever in my never
And I stood outside her heaven
Heaven, heaven, heaven

I can only dream of you and sleep but I'd never see sunlight again
I can try to be with you, but somehow I'll end up just losing a friend
I can only reach for you, relate to you, I'm losing my friend
Where did she go? Where?

Effacer quelques lignes de ma main
Et si je m'en sors
Je veux encore sentir la chaleur
De ce beau matin, ensemble, alli√©s
Contre un drole de destin

Je ne connais pas le plus dur
Je n'ai pas vraimentt de blessures
Sans vous je n'existerais pas
Sans vous je ne me connais pas

De cette hisoire qui me touche
C'est qu'il n'y a rien a regretter
Quelques silences au fond de moi
Y'a des silences et c'est comme ca

Et si je m'en sors
Un peu plus forte
Etre normale pour etre bien
Effacer quelques lignes de ma main

Let's get it on I'm bad to the bone, edgin yo dome
What you know about a baby hummer sittin' on chrome
Make moves like I'm grown with a style of my own
See the ice around my neck I go to school in a rover
Fifth grader seventy dollar phone two way pager
I'm a major, in other words I got flavor
I wreck mics rip shows and kick floors
Lil' Ro' got y'all throwin' ya bows
I'm bout that if you hatin' then stop that
Top that any club I rock that
Now rock that we takin' our spot back
If you tryna stunt lil wodie I doubt that

I'm that cool cat nice with the ball, nicer than y'all
You better take your points cause you might not score
I'm guaranteed M.V.P. hit jumpers and score
Somethin' like Allen I. but I play like I'm tall
Corn raise starch glaise when I walk through the mall
Let my pants sag and always find time to talk to 'em all
I love movies buy a new CD every Tuesday

Keys in my pocket so these skills gonna do me
I practice y'all I'ma do this thing truly

Sound like a wild animal I need to be in a cage
I'm dangerous man in so many ways
I rip shows don't sleep shorty I'm woke
I been practicin since the age of four
I got my mind right I'm up in the limelight
I guess you hate me when you know that I rhyme tight
Nicer than nice I'm skillful make you think twice
What's my name Lil' Ro, I'm larger than life
When I'm not pushin a hummer I'm ridin' a bike
A Lil' Soulja what they call me I go off on the mic
If a ticket was around my neck it would be covered in ice
And my wrist stay blingin it's a lovable site
I'm ragin on all types of stages
You might be nice but see I'm the greatest
Wanna see me take it home from the stages

For a man just looking for the next cheap rhyme
Visualizing paradise is a
Thing I don't wanna do, a thing I don't wanna do

What's gone and what's gonna be

Yo whassup man, get up man (*urrp* I can't bust man)
Get up nigga, bust (I'm fucked)
Get up you gotta do your verse nigga
(Aight I'll try it) Get up nigga!

Verse One: J-Ro

I get drunk and I stumble to the phone
And conjure up a bitch to bone when I'm alone
Oh shit, tow back, I need to take a piss
Only when I'm drunk I sing a song like this
My grandma and your grandma *urrp*
Sittin' by the fire
Hold on, turn the beat off (nah, keep it goin'
J-Ro can you make it?) I'm just not knowin'
I get drunk and start talkin' mo' shit
And when I got a gun in my hand you better get, out
Cause my brain just ain't what it used to be
Forget tryin' to raionalize, cover your eyes
Ah d-*urrp*, damn I'm drunk
I need a chunk, no better yet a hunk of that funk
When I get drunk I might act uncouth
But when I get drunk I always tell the truth
Yeah I'm good, I'm bad, I'm dope, I'm freaky fresh
I make hip-hop fans say yes yes
The Liks comin' through, you know we gonna blow upop
Hold up, hold up, I think I gotta...
*Urrrrrrp* Damn, false alarm
Gettin' all the ladies with my cool charm
When I get drunk I might even call my daddy a punk
Yeah, but only when I'm dr-*urp* drunk

Yeah, let me pass the forty, to my nigga, Tash

Verse Two: Tash, E-Swift

It goes one for the chronic, two for the amnesia
It's the pimp-slap niggy with drinks in the freezer
Bust the one out, two out, (flips) type of rapper
That'd get you our your seat quicker than a car jacker
Slip a Colt for the fever when I'm coolin with my people
Got hoes in East Columus like I'm BIlly Dee Wrinkle
'Cause I move like, I'm smooth like I'm Harry Belafonte
Lookin' for them niggaz that jumped my homey Dante
All up in this bitch with the gin and Tanqueray
Drink like Mr. Wendal smoke bud like Dr. Dre
But that's 'cause I'm old enough to do that type of shit
Got damn I gotta piss I pass the mic to E-Swift

Yeah, I get drunk and can't nobody whoop me
I'm trippin', must be the brew that I was sippin
Kickin in, guess I shouldn'ta mixed it with the gin
'Cause when I'm layin on my back I can feel the room spin
One too many, I reckon
Feelin' I got ta earl, any second
Wanna get up but can't move, feels like I'm stuck in the groove
What the fuck was I tryin' to prove?
I get a rep for downin four-o's
All the hoes knows them Alkaholik bros
Niggaz call me dad I got a fifth in the trunk
Might fuck an ugly bitch but only when I'm drunk

Verse Three: J-Ro

Aight, think I'm feelin' a little better
Ready to bust this, like this
And ya don't miss, check it out

I get drunk and start thinkin' bout my friends
That passed on with every forty ounce the memory will last on
Black Man Muzzle, Mike Lee and Suavey D
The three MC's will always live in my memories
We used to rock shows, we used to rock hoes
And drink forty-o's, and wear the same clothes
Damn I wish we could go through it again
But I know one day we gonna do it again
And when that day comes it's gonna be live
But I ain't in no hurry so I don't drink and drive
The ALkaholiks we gets funky when we drinkin'
Just a lil sumthin, to pump up the thinkin'

Outro: J-Ro

The only ecstacy I fuck with rolls with Jalil
No grip, straight line rhymes
Like the grand concourse on 149
In LA the riders ridge was Fairfax and Olympic ???
On the block the Ethiopians kick it (salaam)
You'll learn Angel City'll test you
I move through giving respect where respect's due
Ducking these cops who say they serve to protect you
And handlin my biz so I ain't tryin' to impress you

I do strategy, I don't act sporadically
I contemplate, cat I move mathematically
It's Alchemist with Dilated, that's family

Still a couple lessons I can teach
How the real fiends cop two each
The game is keeping dope in the streets
So look the world on wheels
Still a couple lessons I can teach
How the real heads rock real beats
Bangin' out the illest rides on the streets
Look at the world on wheels

Peace King, peace haki, peace queen

I only leave 'em in pieces if they step in the ring
They're fumbling and wondering what weapon to bring
I'm like Ice-T, I know my lethal weapon'll swing
Stop the presses, block the doors
Cops oppress us, watch the wolves
But all the friendly fire is worse than oppression
Pressure more stressin is poured in dead presidents (Rakaa)
Fights for your rights is my pleasure
But suckers swing rulers like swords that try to measure
While Slick Rick the ruler's at war with INS yo
I hope the young fly their best yo
Hip-hop desert again, it's like Busy Bee's buzzin again
My patience is thin though
I ventilate 'em like I cracked the window and air it out like a Hail Mary to the end zone

When I'm all out, I cause panic (peace summits)
When I move stealth (it's mysteries and who-done-its)
I made mental notes of who's fam and who frontin
Mental notes of who ran shit and who runnin'

Ven y sana mi dolor‚Ä¶ Tienes la cura de este amor‚Ä¶
Hago este llamado para que tu vuelvas
T√∫ No ves que estoy sufriendo, que es muy dura esta prueba

Abr√°zame y dime que me amas Abrazame‚Ä¶ y dime que me amas
Qu√©date‚Ä¶(hey y dale alivio a
mi alma, iny√©ctale calma) qu√©date..
Que tu no ves que por tu amor yo me muero ma'
Sin ti mi camino se desaparece
Sin ti las espinas son las que florecen
Sin ti yo no vivo sin ti no se escribe la historia del amor
Sin ti mi poema se queda sin verso
Sin ti no ilumina la estrella en mi universo
mis signos vitales van disminuyendo, ven por favor...

Ven aqu√≠ r√°pido ven aqu√≠ r√°pido

I guess I'm no used to being alone... yeah

And I'm trying to face this reality

Knowing now that it's wrong
It's too late 'cause she's gone

That I let her heart down completely
I should've gave her all of me

Being strong to carry on ain't easy
Gotta face it she's gone... gone

This house is cold
It's like doing time in the pen
Wondering where she is and who she with... yeah
But the hardest thing is there's no one else to blame but me
So I guess I have to take it like a man
But I don't know if I'll ever love again
Yeah... yeah

'Cause this pain I'm feeling inside is like a hollow point through my heart
I know that it's kinda crazy
But I feel like I'm falling apart
Usually I'm so cool, but I lost it when
She walked away
Lost without her... and she's gone

Gone... gone... gone
Don't think she's ever coming back
It's killing me
That I let her heart down completely
I should've gave her all of me
She's gone
Gone... gone... gone
She ain't even thinkin' 'bout me honestly
Being strong to carry on ain't easy
Gotta face it she's gone... gone

Without some kind of intervention
I can't go on another day... oh
And I can't even bare to mention
The very sound of her name
Without the sky turnin' into clouds
Without the rain falling down
Falling down... again... again
I can't face the fact that she's gone

Gone... gone... gone
Don't think she's ever coming back
It's killing me
That I let her heart down completely
I should've gave her all of me
She's gone
Gone... gone... gone
She ain't even thinkin' 'bout me honestly

Ain't that the way it goes

When you cheated, girl
My heart bleeded, girl
So it goes without saying
That you left me feeling hurt

Just a classic case
A scenario
Tale as old as time
Girl you got what you deserved

And now you want somebody
To cure the lonely nights
You wish you had somebody
That could come and make it right

But girl I ain't somebody

My moment of truth is fast on its way
Soon I will know for once and for all so I'll just cross my fingers and let the chips fall

The life that I'm living is just half a life the girl that I married is just half a wife
But my life without her would be no life at all
Still I must know the truth so let the chips fall

Ah dear friend I remember that night
The moon and the dreams we shared
Your trembling paw in my hand
Dreaming of that northern land
Touching me with a kiss of a beast

I know my dreams are made of you
Of you and only for you
Your ocean pulls me under
Your voice tears me asunder
Love me before the last petal falls

As a world without a glance
Of the ocean's fair expanse
Such the world would be
If no love did flow in thee
But as my heart is occupied
Your love for me now has to die
Forgive me I need more than you can offer me

Didn't you read the tale
Where happily ever after was to kiss a frog?
Don't you know this tale
In which all I ever wanted
I'll never have
For who could ever learn to love a beast?

However cold the wind and rain
I'll be there to ease your pain
However cruel the mirrors of sin
Remember beauty is found within

To the first show. We're on the road.

May 22nd, '06.
Zoli just tried to ignite a Roman candle stick.
We're troubling the stateside with CIS.
A full blown assault on the whole U.S.
Take on the world, and see it all.

Even as we get older
We can do it all over.
Make our own plans and score the music to our own lives.
Looking into the future,
There is more room to move here.
Invincible as we score the music to our own lives.

And dreams lived all throughout '07.
EU kinships with No Trigger begin.
Anticipating the fall with New Found.
Awe struck by GB in Berlin.
And sometimes snacksidents will happen,
And it's so hard to keep your razzberry cool.
""Hey, I'm in Georgia with Fireworks and Justin K.
We're all in a holding cell but somehow Baloni got away.""
""I'm just trying to get my smoothie on, dawg.""

Even as we get older
We can do it all over.
Make our own plans and score the music to our own lives.
Looking into the future,
There is more room to move here.
Invincible as we score the music to our own lives.

Now we gotta react, we gotta think fast.
Side bust wits leave us delirious.
Outspoken hearts, restless as sharks. My life, my pride.
Save me the daylight, Bring me home, It's OK cause
My way has only got to work for me.
I'm trying my hardest to make the most of every minute.
Time flies. And the top of the world is calling.
Time grabs me by the shoulders.
We're holding on.

I remember the time we were on our first tour.
We were out in Texas...

Even as we get older
We can do it all over.
Make our own plans and score the music to our own lives.
Looking into the future,
There is more room to move here.
Invincible as we score the music to our own lives.
Score the music to our own lives"

They say we're unhappy and we'll break apart
But darling it's not true because I still love you and I do it all of my heart

The Human Cannonball
Died in Sarasota Monday
Eighty-four was all
From Italy in Thirty-four
John Ringling brought him here
Broken neck in Fifty-one
Ended his career

But in those years in between
Seventeen in all
Few flew as fast or as far
As the Cannonball
Fifty-eight yards and one foot
Was the distance that he went
Fifty-four miles in an hour
The speed that he was sent

Two of his brothers and two daughters
Nine grandchildren in all
And the one great grandchild
Survive the Cannonball
He died on Monday where he lived
It happens to us all
Shot through the air expecting nets
A flight and then a fall"

As you die die die
In this bed not making a sound

It has all come crashing down
To be here and watch you breathe your last
So helpless to stop you from slipping away so fast

Oh God are you listening now
As this cancer dances through her and then takes a bow
It won't disappoint the crowd

Whose words are a curse
As I hear them one by one
Each pull, the string, and I come undone

I know this, I failed to say
(I'm sinking by your side)
You're worth this, I wouldn't trade a day
To not have gone though this

So many days I've been blind,
I want to stop and rewind
Kick off our shoes and dance
With the ghost of you

Who could tease me
And leave me begging for the abuse
You're the only one I knew
That could tame me and make me who I am

But now, it's all fading,
And there's nothing left of all my plans

I know this, I failed to say
(I'm sinking by your side)
You're worth this, I wouldn't trade a day
To not have gone though this

So many days I've been blind,
I want to stop and rewind
Kick off our shoes and dance
Let's dance again,
We'll turn up our sleeves,
I know just where to begin

Dance, let's dance again,
We could find ourselves before this happened

These words of mine are trite and so clich√©
And still they find their place in everything
It's just to break the silence that has been crushing me

Half of me is dead, already gone
And half is screaming everyone is wrong
I'm finally asking now will you

Just hear me out
This was all my fault
Now you've brought me death
And it's everything I wanted

It's the wrong side of fear that kept me out"

Fame and fortune is they're reward

They must know
What goes up must come down
Except when the Lord takes you on higher ground

And set their minds to reach their goals
What will it profit a man
To gain this world and lose his soul?
A world of pride
Where people are forced to compromise
But in the end
They know they're never really satisfied
They've gotta know
The world only gives guarantees that will not last
Knowing not who holds the future,
Who holds the present or the past
On Christ the rock you must stand
For the ground where you are standing
Is nothing but sinking sand
Only what you do
For Jesus Christ will last
Everything else will fade
Like the future becomes the past

Waiting for the morning light
And all the things I've seen in dreams
Have kept me up all night
Always reaching to the sky
Soft hard stone
I'm sitting here and thinking
Bout all the centuries its known
Got a feeling someone's near
Listening to the East wind moan
You know there's no one here
But I just don't feel alone

Fading Lady Light
Always here with me
Singing your song in the wind at night
You know I've never felt so free
You're my reality
Don't you fade away from me
The wind it paints your face
As it stirs the shifting sand
Nightmare creatures closing in
They leave at your command
If only you were beside me now
Maybe I would understand
And I could leave my dreams for life
To live the dream we planned"

There's no place to hide 
And you can't find love on Locust Street 
But you can hear the sunrise crying 
Can't you hear the sunrise crying 
A song for you alone 

Just a glimpse of what love could be 
Once a dream that I owned 
What of many lonely longing souls 
At least I'm not alone 
Well at least I'm not alone 

Ripe off the vine now lay rotten
Like a dead end street forever forgotten

And it's easy pick-ins on Locust Street 
There's no place to hide
And you can't find love on Locust Street
But you can hear the sunrise crying
Can't you hear the sunrise crying
Can't you hear the sunrise crying
A song for you alone
A song for you alone"

What you're feeling is pressure
Pulsate new blood

I've seen things you've heard never before
Bones aged in dust
Buy your bite, take the body

Calm, shutting down
You built me
I knew it

I'll never lie, liar
You fed me
I chewed it

I'll never lie, liar
I follow you, covering me
Spirits in pieces
Crumbled and burnt"

Si tu es prisonnier, si tu es prisonnier

I wish I could have been there 
To see Your first step, hear Your very first word 
Tell me, did You ever fall and scrape Your knee? 
Did You know Your wounds would one day heal the world? 

For just one moment 
I wish I could have seen You growing 
Learning the ways of a carpenter's son 
Just a little boy gazing at the stars 
Did You remember creating every one? 

If You passed by, would I have seen a child or a King? 
Would I have known? 

I wish I could have been there 
My only wish is to see You face to face 
Wish I could have been there 
Just to see You, Jesus, face to face 

For just a moment 
I wish I could have been there 
When You left Your footprints upon the waves 
To walk along beside You and never look away 
Just Your whisper and the wind and sea obey 

To see You feed the people 
To feel Your healing in Your touch 

To hear You pray in the garden alone 
Laying down Your will with each tear 
To see You walk that lonely road 
Willing to die for me 
And in that moment 
I know I should have been there 
You took my cross and gave Your life 

And You live again! 
Wish I could have been there 
My only wish is to see You rise again 
Wish I could have been there 
My only wish is to see You, Jesus, face to face 
Someday I'll be there, I'm gonna be there 
I'll see Your face, Your mercy, Your grace 
Someday, someday 
I'm gonna see You, Jesus

My eternal jam is the juice of the radio
Takin' out profanity so they can play it though
Listen to a hell of a kick and the high hat
Going to the record store say ya gonna buy
That the E is connected to the A and the Z ya say Y
So that's how the beats stack it up on material made of hits
Takin' my time of each line to make sure it fits
Push play on the instrumental that's recorded
Step on stage and I'm suddenly awarded
Some sort of track appeared like a plaque
And some hell of a scream from the girls in the back
Takin' a bow 'cause I got style
Never at the bottom of the ways on the top of the pile
Yo it's Eazy on top even though I'm short
Guarenteed to help when I walk on the court
So get up make some noise for the gangsta clap
Gonna tip the laugh I'm not a pranksta
I'm serious Dre my sounds so quit playin' around
'Cause I'mma break it down

(Eazy-E)
Last time I was takin' my time with this
But other suckaz were makin' a rhyme with this
I had to change the tip or make it hyper
But they was rotten, I was gettin' riper
Ready to go, like never before
Givin' you more because I'm ready to score
Ren is my buddy you can tell I said often
Helpin' me destroy the suckaz that's softin'
Curin' diseases, my rhyme pleases, throw it a key
Balls havin' seasons, this is a doctrine
And I'm locked in, and I made up my mind
And I think I'm gonna rock then
You got beaches chill and I'mma push ya
To freeze after I'll cut ya 'cause I'mma butcher
And say ya have pricin' and then out ya go
Cause a percentage on point bellys are very low
Messin' with a gun but once ya get hurt
Like a said before ya get rubbed in the dirt
I'm not a law man, but I'mma raw man
M.C. Ren: ""But ya the dopest one I ever saw!""
I keep droppin' it pound for pound
And when I'm on the mic I always throw down
To keep y'all dancin' to my funky sound
So listen 'cause I'mma break it down

(Eazy-E)
Now look at me and not the poster
And you could see right off I got the most of
The talent, experience or a trade
And complements for the rhyme that's made
Talks over today if this one so
Pick another artist and dis one
I got the ballet of the chosen vote
'Cause I don't need water to clear my throat
Comin' from the rain the show is like dancin'
Nasty like and the girls are like glancin'
Wantin' to get wit me this routine
Keepin' it sprung still stayin' mean
Can ya dis this man I don't think so
Once I start writin' the way I let the ink go
Comin' out with songs like hit after hit
Cause this is legit and yours ain't shit
Makin' it sound so dope 'cause I'm a genius
But your amazed with ya happy to see this
Brother go crazy on wax
Flowin' away like if I was on a sax
Doin' a solo in the shade I'm a spotlight
Relax and chill while your up tight
Pumpin' up the funky sounds
Yo you should know it's kinda persist
That the E is gonna break it down"

O'er hills and meadows we'd stray
Just a boy and his dog, we both full of fun
We grew up together that way

I remember the time at the old swimmin' hole
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
Shep was right there, to the rescue he came
He jumped in and helped pull me out

So the years sped along and at last he grew old
His eyesight was fast growin' dim
Then one day, the doctor looked at me and said
""I can't do no more for him, Jim""

With a hand that was tremblin', I picked up my gun
I aimed it at Shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it, I wanted to run
And I wished they'd shoot me instead

I went to his side and I sat on the ground
He laid his head on my knee
I stroked the best pal that a man ever found
I cried, so I scarcely could see

Old Sheppie, he knew he was goin' to go
For he reached out and licked at my hand
He looked up at me, just as much as to say
""We're partin' but you understand""

Now Old Shep is gone where the good doggies go
And no more with Old Shep will I roam
But if dogs have a Heaven, there's one thing I know
Old Shep has a wonderful home"

Blade catches the light of your eyes
The man slowly comes undone

No one saw a thing
All turned a blind eye to the fallen
And the bad luck he brings

You wake in the morning after
The sky's a color that you can't see
Friends have fallen by the wayside
Why isn't anyone talking to me
Get those funny looks in the market
People you loved just stare
Wander on with your hands in your pockets
Even your girlfriend don't care

They've all come to watch the emperor
They've all come to watch the emperor
They've all come to watch the emperor

To watch the emperor fall

One part truth
Three parts deceit
Two parts shit that you made up
Add passion for heat

Did ya hear he said this
Can you believe he done that
Can you believe the nerve of the man
Let me at him tell me where he's at
Wake to your fave in the mirror
See someone you don't recognize
Stare at the changes in the reflection

It's enough to give an average, sensitive person the blues.
Can't get it up
I don't know about commercial appeal
But what you put in your head
Just can't help affect how you feel
So lets keep it up
Prophets of doom try to capture you
They get around like the asian flu,
But they can't get me
Because I go for the up

I'm on the up side
I look for the up (that down just ain't my style)
I go for the up
I'm hooked on the up
I'm on the upswing (I got my sights set high)
I go for the up


What's the point of standing out in the rain,
What's the sense of looking down,
It just gives your shoulders a pain
Can't get it up
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy
If you look for the worst then that's just
What it turns out to be
So keep looking up
The fickle finger just may point your way
It touches someone different every day,
But it can't touch me
Because I go for the up

And everybody's yelling at me to get back in line,
And they say I'm crazy,
But still they have their sessions of deep depressions,
But it can't get me
Because I go for the up"

It's so funny runnin' into you
It has to be three years
Since we last seen each other
Many flashbacks come to mind
Of the wild and crazy times
We used to have with one another

We absolutely didn't care
We would do it anywhere
Eye contact, and it was over, hmm
But that's when I was wild, and now
I couldn't care less about
Someone gettin' hurt
I've done my share of dirt
But I done wised up

Chorus - Seein' you reminds me of
All the nights I used to beat it up
I would do it again, but I can't
'Cause everything is different now
I finally have settled down
And became a one woman man

Ooh
There were many others after you
Quite a few one night stands
Some of their names I can't remember
Imagine wakin' up with someone who
You barely even knew
Time and time again

But there's someone for everyone
I've been blessed to find that one
Who makes me feel like no other
You are lookin' good as hell
But I can't go home with you
Because I'm goin' home to her

Long gone, are the days
When I ran the streets
Tryin' to get laid
Ooh, and now
(See now that I found the love of my life)

But I gotta go home to my baby boo

Skinny from the many that try to eat plenty

Where the smoke is hanging still
Like an echo of an age long forgotten.
There's a story of a home
Crushed beneath those blackened stones
And a roof that fell before the beams were rotten.
See, Saul Darby loved his wife
And he laboured all his life
To provide her with material possessions
And he built for her a home
Of the finest wood and stone
And the building soon became his sole obsession.

Oh it took three hundred days
For the timber to be raised
And the silhouette was seen for miles around
And the gables reached as high
As the eagles in the sky
But it only took one night to bring it down --
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.

Though the shared a common bed
There was precious little said
In the moments that were set aside for sleeping.
For his busy dreams were filled
With the rooms he'd yet to build
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.
Then one night he heard a sound
As he laid his pencil down
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle,
And the pale light of the moon, 
Through the windows of the room,
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.

Oh it took three hundred days
For the timber to be raised
And the silhouette was seen for miles around
And the gables reached as high
As the eagles in the sky
But it only took one night to bring it down --
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground."

Coming through

Well they tore another building down
It's nothing new
This town is through

There's a feeling I get when I talk to you mama
So we're going out west where the winds won't harm us now
And the car is in the lane
We'll never be the same

The stores are setting up for Halloween
Back at school the kids are cool
Painted ponies in this one horse town
Are getting old
I've been bought and sold

There's a feeling I get when I talk to you mama

A beat in the heat of noon;
There's a song as the day grows long,
And a tempo in the tides of the moon.
It's all around us and it's everywhere,
And it's deeper than Royal blue.
And it feels so real you can feel the feeling!

And that's The Majesty Of Rock!
The fantasy of Roll!
The ticking of the clock,
The wailing of the soul!
The prisoner in the dock,
The digger in the hole,
We're in this together... and ever...

In the shade of a jungle glade,
Or the rush of the crushing street,
On the plain, on the foamy main,
You can never escape from the beat.
It's in the mud and it's in your blood
And its conquest is complete.
And all that you can do is just surrender.

To the Majesty of Rock!
The Pageantry of Roll!
The crowing of the cock,
The running of the foal!
The shepherd with his flock,
The miner with his coal,
We're in this together... and ever...

When we die, do we haunt the sky?
Do we lurk in the murk of the seas?
What then? Are we born again?
Just to sit asking questions like these?
I know, for I told me so,
And I'm sure each of you quite agrees:
The more it stays the same, the less it changes!

And that's The Majesty Of Rock!
The Mystery of Roll!
The darning of the sock,
The scoring of the goal!
The farmer takes a wife
The barber takes a pole.
We're in this together... and ever..."

Great disease was mighty and the people were sick everywhere.
It was an epidemic, it floated through the air.

The doctors they got troubled and they didn't know what to do.
They gathered themselves together, they called it the Spanishin flu.

Soldiers died on the battlefield, died in the counts too.
Captain said to the lieutenant, ""I don't know what to do.""

Well, God is warning the nation, He's a-warning them every way.
To turn away from evil and seek the Lord and pray.

But I can not hide
The revelations riding through the night
Can't you feel the pain
So I can not die
Our domination will defeat mankind!

I'll open fire shooting first
The warrior that I am is cursed
You should hide from the oppression, oppression
Bravely self-willed to survive

Carry on to feel the glory
The victory is everywhere

Words she washed with tears and planted in my soul

Can we just go back to the simple kinda living?
Can we just go back and maybe start from the beginning?
Back to better days, when love was for the giving
Can we just go back to the way we were?

Mama said there was a time when brothers were each others keepers
Sisters held each other close till there was nothing left between them
Back when a song was a song you could sing along didn't matter how long
Just as long as it spoke to ya, sung to ya
Do you know what I mean?

Now I'm chasing rainbows and dreams,
Trying hard to believe

By then it may be too late, maybe we can start today"

He said, I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
Oh and I'm gonna buy this place, is what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head

Honey, all the movements you're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They said start as you mean to go on
Start as you mean to go on

Said, I'm gonna buy this place and see it go
Stand here beside me baby, watch the orange glow
Some'll laugh and some just sit and cry
But you just sit down there and you wonder why

So I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
And I'm gonna buy this place, is what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head
Oh to the head

Honey, all the movements you're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They say start as you mean to go on
Start as you mean to go on
As you mean to go on

So meet me by the bridge
Oh meet me by the lane
When am I gonna see
That pretty face again?

Oh meet me on the road
Meet me where I said
Blame it all upon
A rush of blood to the head"

And you still can't let go?

I was naive
Your love was like candy
Artificially sweet
I was deceived by the wrapping
Got caught in your web
And I learned how to bleed
I was prey in your bed
And devoured completely

And it hurts my soul
'Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
'Cause I, I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

I should have known
I was used for amusement
Couldn't see through the smoke
It was all an illusion
Now I've been licking my wounds (licking my wounds)
But the venom seeps deeper (deeper, deeper)
We both can seduce
But darling you hold me prisoner (prisoner)

I'm about to break
I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure
And I'm fiendin' for a cure
Every step I take
Leads to one mistake
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need...

I can't mend
This torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya

Everytime I try to grasp for air
I get smothered in despair, it's never over, over
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare,
I let out a silent prayer
That it be over, over

Inside I'm screaming,
Begging pleading no more

I don't know what to do
My heart has been bruised
So sad but it's true
Each beat reminds me of you

It hurts my soul
'Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
Cause i
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need, oh

I keep going right back

I say...
I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

Only thing I need to do is walk away

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

I need to walk away from ya

Damned if we do, we'll be damned if we don't

And when they've used you, you'll be left on your own!

The war machine will consume us all

They call it progress, I call it a scam
Push blindly forward without asking why

(Verse 1: Lloyd Banks)

When I was 10 years old I seen a nigga take 3 in the head
Probably around the same time you use to pee in the bed
I'd stay awake cause my nightmares was seein' him dead
The smell of burnt tires peelin after leavin' him lead
The killer fled with a fuckin' laugh
My heart pumpin on blast
I just stare at him slumped in the grass
Arms movin, fingers shakin, spittin' up blood
DNA mixed in the mud, another ditch to be dug
Their I stood stiffer than wood it's the homie that use to buy me candy
Now he's gone who's gonna provide his family
My air bring this shit up 'n' runnin' I never thought I'd be that sick
Damn I wasn't suppose to see that shit
That's when I thought, it was more than 3 shots
It could have been the aimin for me, maybe he circled around the block
I turned around and my pops, he like 'what happened?'
This nigga rolled up and just started clappin', I can still hear him laughin'

In the street of new york you can't trust nobody
Niggas'll run up on you with a 12 gauge shoty
Loyalty comes free and smokin' weed is my hobby
You wanna rob me you gotta leave here with a body

(Verse 2: Lloyd Banks)

It was a regular day in southside, sprinklers 'n' kids runnin'
And all of a sudden heads turnin', somebody did sumthin
This nigga named, I forgot, fuck it he lived around the block
Regular getting' money nigga but loved to clown a lot
Walk across the park stuntin' and frontin'
Diamonds in his ears, diamond watch on, eatin a bag of popcorn
Walked up behind a shorty and grabbin' her waist
She pushed him away
So he threw the bag in her face
She felt disrespected, shorty couldn't accept it
Called him a pussy told him she'd be back in a second
But he ain't payin' no mind called her a bitch about 4 times
Stayed in the park, with no niggas with him and no nine
And then in no time an older nigga from behind
Swung a baseball bat
Left his face all crack
Told him to take all that
Hit him again popped his chain with a frown
And left the clown with a stain on the ground

In the street of new york you can't trust nobody
Niggas'll run up on you with a 12 gauge shoty
Loyalty comes free and smokin' weed is my hobby
You wanna rob me you gotta leave here with a body

(Verse 3: Lloyd Banks)

Now all my days go by blowin' that sicky icky
California made me picky
Chickenheads tryin' to stick me with a hicky
If we, roll up quickly, stick me, some was tipsy
The location don't matter I'm southside until they hit me
I'd be dead
If looks can kill, I'm from the ghetto boys
But I don't know scarface or Bushwick Bill, My heart spills
For the kids who ain't got nothing and who got to steal, and from my
Cousin I lost, lookd over the steerin wheel

In the street of new york you can't trust nobody
Niggas'll run up on you with a 12 gauge shoty
Loyalty comes free and smokin' weed is my hobby
You wanna rob me you gotta leave here with a body"

Looked for the Swan Boats In Mattapan well, I find that real amusing

They came to Boston for an education live in the dorms, join a frat
Jam my bars and subway cars now, what the fuck is that?
Spend year one having fun and causing aggravation
Spending daddy's cash on a toga bash when the hell's graduation?

Mit der Kraft der Sch√∂nheit hat sie Odins Volk getr√ºgt.

Einmal in der Feste luden Odin und die andren
Gullveig ein zutrinken, sie nahm an.
Als das Fest gefeiert wurde fing sie an zu reden
√úber Gold und Geld und was man damit alles kann.
Viele Asen h√∂rten zu und fingen an zu schmachten,
Wollten Reichtum, stritten dann und schlugen aufeinander ein.

Als der Streit am √§rgsten war, die Asen sich bekriegten,
Blickte Vater Odin, Gullveig ins Gesicht.
Er sah wie sie lachte, wie sie dieser Groll erfreute.
Dass dort Schwerter kreisten, darum scherte sie sich nicht.
""Br√ºder"", rief er ""haltet ein! Das Weib will uns vernichten.
Zwietracht ist der Hexensaat, es keimt in ihrem Blut!""

Kaum gesprochen endete der Kampf der Asenmeute.
Alle blickten j√§hlings auf die Hexe voller Hass.
Gullveig f√ºhlte Augenblicklich, dass die List nicht gl√ºckte.
Sie fing an zu zittern, wurde pl√∂tzlich leichenblass.
Odin schrie: ""Dein falsches spiel soll deinen Tod besiegeln.
Brennen sollst du Hexenweib, dein Ende sei gewiss!""

Augenblicklich st√ºrzten sich die Asen auf die Hexe,
Banden sie und schlugen ihr die F√§uste in den Leib.
Odin sprach: ""Der Scheiterhaufen soll dein Ende bringen,
Niemand st√∂rt der Asenruhe UND NUN BRENNE WEIB!""
Kaum gesprochen ward es wahr, die Hexe stand in Flammen.
Als das Feuer ausgebrannt war, lachte Gullveig laut.

""Niemand ist imstande, mir mein Leben zu entrei√üen"",
Sprach die Riesin, doch die Asen taten es erneut.
Weitere zwei Male wollten sie das Weib entz√ºnden,
Doch die Hexe starb nicht und das hat sie nicht erfreut.

A fool for your loving no more

I'm tired of hiding my feelings
You left me lonely too long
I gave my heart and you tore it apart
Oh baby, you done me wrong

Don't come running to me
I know I've done all I can
A hard loving woman like you
Just makes a hard loving man

So I can say it to you baby
I'll be a fool for your loving no more
Fool for your loving no more
I'm so tired of trying
I always end up crying
A fool for your loving no more
I'll be a fool for your loving no more

There came a chance, that I took and ran.

There came a point where it all made sense.

If what you have is right then I'll die being wrong.

Own your future, your own happiness is what you decide.

And she said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back to me
In my mind

How can I be strong?
I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions you had many
I know you did

I come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
Never fall again

Making love to you felt so good
And oh so right

How can I be strong?
I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

So here we are alone again
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss

I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
Don't think I can take the pain
Never fall again

Kinda late in the game
And my heart is in your hands
Don't you stand there and then tell me
You love me, then leave again
'Cause I'm falling in love with you again

Hold me, hold me
Don't ever let me go
Say it just one time
Say you love me
God knows I do love you again"

Stranded, tied, stiletto heels
Tying Up, no regrets
Living high, stay low
Kicking it out in style
Another day, another dollar, another notch in the belt
Kick it out
Fallen down

Where the day goes
Where the day
Where the day takes your underground uplifting
Where the day eludes truth, lies, opinion
Where the day takes you

Running red, sorry for humanity
Say you're lovesick in her world
Turning tricks
Another angel gets her wings
Clipped away
Old soul of love words of lovesick
Sad parade gone by
Gone by
Locked and settled down
They prey the proud, the proud

Save your lungs, your shit, your life

As I leave the hall
To heed this call

High above
Roses climb
As evening's hours die
A distant cry

I must leave
All behind
Shed all those ties that bind
My tethered mind

Darkened light
I must take care
Never shine to bright
Stay out of sight

Once, on a windswept shore
I stood alone
Sensed that far cry
Across the reach

Tool the bell
For this sad world
Was my prison cell
A pleasant hell

End this pain
End my time
In this blind god's domain
Of brutal claim

Fragrant night
Give me shelter
From these stars too bright
And hide my flight"

When I used to know a little girl high on this world
Your baby loves you more than you know
Raised on rivalry and rock'n roll
Moving to the motor City soul 
She lets go
On the radio
Well we never had a lot of cash
But we loved those kids
Some say that she missed the boat
But she just burned the bridge
The angels love you more than you know
Raised on robbery and rock'n roll
Moving to the Motor City soul
She takes hold
On the radio
Stomachache Sundays
And books we never read
Well I was hoping one day
We might meet again
She used to talk about astrology
She was born in June
She danced with strangers and celebrities
Empty stars and the full moon
I was thinking about the universe
For what its worth
Or the one about the Phoenix bird
That died and then returned
The angels love you more than you know
Raised on robbery and rock' n roll
Moving to the Motor City soul
Moving to the Motor City soul
Sometimes I see her face
When there's no place to go
On the radio
On the radio

And they know it all, but they still ain't seen the truth

He beat them all and then he took 'em all to court

Shadows my russet skin
In views beyond a winter gate

Vivid days of a child
Green are the trees of age
My love for the everlasting sky
Foreboding flames abode 

I will dream under a blacksun
No shelter to hide my skin
Tainted rain will taste so pure

Foretell my name in honor

An unspeakable affair
The lady on the hill 
Creates a glorious 
Departure from her every time 
Or everyday life
Constant swelling of the ankles

A pleasant cry for help 
A pleasant cry for help
A pleasant cry for help

A grieving widow mothered this headless wonder
A perfect crime that soon lived on
A different life it had to develop
Gripped by every limb it could hold
The lifeless ideas it grew onto its own
A much needed surrender
Trees soon started to grow from what seemed a lifeless neck

From a monster to a beauty in quick months
Its life seemed to be on its way to a rare freedom
It decided it should take advantage
Advantage of this idea
Of this idea!

A mixture of plantings soon took course in its body
A spectacle none-the-less
Walking proud through life letting its branches guide the way
A path which seemed to be covered in sunshine

It must be human, for its qualities seem
To outdo even the grandest occupant of the town

This started to catch the attention of the un-branched
It had never experienced an affection of this kind
A wonderful and frightening new obstacle in its life
A wonderful and frightening new obstacle in its life

Years went by as it finally found its true love 
The love of others
Others!
Three to be exact
Letting them into every secret
Feeding from every branch
Every part used for their lives

It noticed its walking seemed more staggered than normal
The breeze didn't flow like it used to
The heart seemed to pound slower and slower
What caused this?
(What caused this?)
It soon was noticed that these three had torn every branch, every single stem

Torn to its last life
How hadn't it noticed?
A drastic change in the surroundings
It didn't think anything could go this wrong

Comfort! 
Comfort!
Comfort!
Comfort!
Comfort!
Comfort!
Comfort!
Comfort! 

It thought life was constant happiness, if constant happiness was all that was given out (Given out!)
It thought life was constant happiness, if constant happiness was all that was given out (Given out!)

Comfort!

Things they would not teach me of in college

Turned into a shining band of gold

You will see it come to its fruition

Vanish in the air, you'll never find me

Apartment 108
I'll always keep you in my heart
Anderson is cold tonight,
The leaves are scattered on the ground
I miss the seasons in the comfort of your smile

Sometimes this song feels like a dream,
I'm waiting for someone just to wake me up from this life
As I look out on these fairgrounds,
I remember how our family split apart

I don't think I ever told you,
But I know you always did your best
In the hard times that only made us stronger

As I sit here all alone,
I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on
When you're gone

I'll never be the same without you,
I love you more than you will ever know
So maybe now you finally know:
Sometimes we're helpless and alone,
But you can't let it keep you weighted down
You must go on

Do you ever feel like crying?
Do you ever feel like giving up?
I raise my hands up towards the sky
And say this prayer for you tonight,
Because nothing is impossible

As I sit here all alone,
I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on
When you're gone

I'll never be the same without you,
I love you more than you will ever know
So maybe now you finally know:
Sometimes we're helpless and alone,
But you can't let it keep you weighted down
You must go on

The hardest part isn't finding what we need to be,
It's being content with who we are

Stay who you are

Stay who you are
Stay who you are

Stay who you are
Stay who you are"

Call this bitch yor nigga when time is rough
I lost a lot when you fell, life is hard to bluff
You think its hell where you at
Shit its hell on the streets
You maintaining in the Bing, I'm surviving to eat
Don't think am wilding, flexing whips and stuff
Thinking I'm lost laying down
Sex for trips and stuff
I'll admit it I'm use to the finer things,
We had major names even on the minor things
Everywhere we went, mad bitches sizing me up
You know they tight now, shit I get to drive the trucks
But I wish you were spreading it riding it rough
I think I miss that more then you buying me stuff
Since you got knocked your man tried to hollar at me
And those nigga's you stuck, they throwing dollars at me
But you know this gaming, and I'm just keeping it real
Holding you down until you back on the field

Feels like I do
I feel when feeling down
In the ground feeling down
It can be most anyday

Don't worry 'bout these streets I'm conrolling these grounds
I might slip and miss a V-I but I'm holding it down
Got the kids to take care its hard out here
And its tearing my heart to play my part out here
I seen that snitch and you know I got plots 4 years
And your bid make me feel like I got the chair
But ain't nobody tapping this I rather tap my own
Watching tapes we made while I'm resting alone
Wishing you home, pictures of you flipping the chrome
What kind of chic will leave her man when he out the zone
Me without you is like a stickman without a silencer
Got me X-ing off days on the calendar
I miss loading the glock so you could control the block
I miss watching you work the dogs to tighten the lock
Think of the time boo pushing it like a 6 double o
You get your weight up I'm a drain you once they let go


I can see us back on the bricks, me on your shoulder
Letting bitches know they wishes to have you are over
So you ring your broads while you locked away
I know its hard for a nigga on top not to play
See Amil's the one you kept draped in ice
I'm the one waiting silk down caked in spice
Waiting for your calls or my box to vibrate
Hoping you want me to come scoop you not being more weight
I fell from Gucci sandals back to no name brands
From a six and a mansion to beating the sands
Staying true make ends meet to have enough for the love I take
All-savage and stuff
Have a brick where most F.E.D.S. dare to touch
Fear none to see the cash, and us popping the clutch
Chopping a Dutch-flip cop twice as much living low key
A minute then heist and stuff
If I have to wait while you gone I'm a take what comes
If you don't see cash, know its hard in the slums

Dirty Dia . . .aa . . .aa . . .come on!

She said I have to go home 
'Cause I'm real tired, you see 
Now I hate sleeping alone
Why don't you come with me
I said my baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight 
I didn't call on the phone 
To say that I'm alright 

Diana walked up to me
She said I'm all yours tonight
At that I ran to the phone
Saying ""Baby, I'm alright""
I said but unlock the door
'Cause I forgot the key
She said he's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me 

Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, nah

Come on!

The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again 
But always in my heart

Oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Oh, kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

But uh-oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's all right (It's all right, it's all right)
My pressure on your hips
I'm sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

Roses in a vase of white
Bloodied by the thorns beside the leaves
That fall because my hand is
Pulling them hard as I can

So I won't run away like I used to do

But I'm only just one person, who am I to disagree?
If I gave you simple reasons, would you still be questioning me?

I climbed a mountain simply looking for advice
But all I found were children playing innocent and nice
And everyone was peaceful, and everyone polite
No one to whisper dreams, what's thought to be a part of life

But I'm only just one second short of calling this my end

It hid the braces on his legs at first

When he looked at me
As he struggled down the driveway, it almost
Made me hurt

Will don't walk too good
Will don't talk too good
He won't do the things that the other kids do,
In our neighborhood

I've been searchin', wonderin', thinkin'
Lost and lookin' all my life
I've been wounded, jaded, loved and hated
I've wrestled wrong and right
He was a boy without a father
And his mother's miracle
I've been readin', writin', prayin', fightin'
I guess I would be still
Yeah, that was until
I knew God's Will

Will's mom had to work two jobs
We'd watch him when she had to work late
And we'd all laugh like I hadn't laughed
Since I don't know when

Hey Jude was his favorite song
At dinner he'd ask to pray
And then he'd pray for everybody in the world but him

Before they moved to California
His mother said, they didn't think he'd live
And she said each day that I have him, well it's just
Another gift
And I never got to tell her, that the boy
Showed me the truth
In crayon red, on notebook paper, he'd written
Me and God love you

Run through the moss on high heels

Waiting for it to come back to me

I want to live near the sea
Crab claws and bottles of rum
That's what I'll have
Staring at the seashell
Waiting for it to embrace me

I put my soul in what I do
Last night I drew a funny man
With dog eyes and a hanging tongue
It goes way bad
I never like that sad look
From someone who wants to be loved by you

I'm very good with plants
When my friends are away
They let me keep the soil moist
On the seventh day I rest
For a minute or two
Then back on my feet to call for you

You've got cucumbers on your eyes
Too much time spent on nothing
Waiting for a moment to arise
The face in the ceiling
And arms too long
I'm waiting for him to catch me

I excel without ever even trying

With the slightest little effort of my ghostlike charms
I have seen grown men give out a shriek
With the wave of my hand and a well-placed moan
I have swept the very bravest off their feet

Yet year after year, it's the same routine
And I grow so weary of the sound of screams
And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King
Have grown so tired of the same old thing

Oh, somewhere deep inside of these bones
An emptiness began to grow
There's something out there, far from my home
A longing that I've never known

I'm a master of fright and a demon of light
And I'll scare you right out of your pants
To a guy in Kentucky, I'm Mister Unlucky
And I'm known throughout England and France

And since I am dead, I can take off my head
To recite Shakespearean quotations
No animal nor man can scream like I can
With the fury of my recitations

But who here would ever understand
That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin
Would tire of his crown, if they only understood
He'd give it all up if he only could

Oh, there's an empty place in my bones

I'm not the Master of the Universe,
I walk the earth the wrong way,
Made my pretension and fulfilled the worst,
My past is cursed, the wrong way.

(The wrong way. The wrong way.)

Your glass is half,
His glass is full,
My glass is empty.
You're running short,
Of not enough,
Well I've got plenty.

I've come a long way,
I went the wrong way.

And who I am, is so goddamned

I'm not the Master of the Universe,
I walk the earth the wrong way,
Made my pretension and fulfilled the worst,
My past is cursed, the wrong way.

And when I die I'm gonna fly,
And come and get you.
And when you try and run,
I'll be the curse above you.

It's got to end. It's got to end.

In the race for disaster I will come in first,
That's what I've learned the hard way.

If you want to know
How far to go,
To Hell, just ask me.
If you want to see
The view from your knees,
Come down and join me.

I've come a long way,
I went the wrong way. [x3]"

Oh, love ain't no stranger, mmm

I looked around, and what did I see?
Broken hearted people staring at me
All searching 'cause they still believe
Oh, love ain't no stranger

I was alone, and I needed love
So much I sacrificed all I was dreaming of
I heard no warning, but a heart can tell
I'd feel the emptiness of love I know so well

Love ain't no stranger
I ain't no stranger
Love ain't no stranger
I ain't no stranger to love, no, no, no

Can't hold the passion of a soul in need
I look for mercy when my heart begins to bleed
I know good loving, I'm a friend of pain
But when I read between the lines, it's all the same

Love ain't no stranger

Love ain't no stranger

Because of His wrath
The mountains tremble
At the sound of His voice
He pulls down the sky
To crush His enemies
He descends upon them with fire
He is clothed in greatness
His voice resounds throughout the earth
His vengeance no longer is contained
His light destroys the darkness
If He speaks the earth will crumble
If He moves the universe will fall
He is clothed in greatness
His voice resounds throughout the earth
With the valleys of the seas exposed
And the surface of the earth laid bare
He reached down into the void
He reached down and took hold of me!

And I think of all the things, what you're doing

Well, my body's been a mess
And I miss your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress

Ah, won't you come on over
And stop making a fool out of me

Did you have to go to jail
Put your house up for sale
Did you get a good lawyer
Hope you didn't catch a tan
Hope you'll find the right man
Who'll fix it for ya

Are you shopping anywhere
Change the color of your hair
Are you busy
And did you have to pay that fine
You was dodging all the time
Are you still busy

Whoever is on the front line is gettin' struck first
We mercinaries, fuck turf
Every verse is varied, I bust first
Mayday, Natural Elements controllin' the ship
Rollin' a spliff that'll probably put my soul in a twist
But I remain bonin' a bitch
Got her buck-naked posin' for flicks
Actin' like she was never known for the shit
But I look over the shoulder and see the enemy lookin'
Physically strong but mentally shooken
And for penetentiary bookin's this shit happens
Get orders from my nigga Charlemagne the ship Captain
You sound like a bitch yappin'
This shit is all Natural to us
Like blowin' endo out the window in the back of the bus
I move back and I bust
Rapid fire
You actin' flyer
Now your family's in black attire
With mad desire
When we caught you in the line of duty
You had it in your mind to shoot me
But every soldier of my kind sollutes me
Now I'm reclinin' with a Lucy
All of my niggas
Smoke it down to the filter
Holdin' a frown with a picture
You smell the smoke when I walk past
You saw blasts
You should've known about the drama in my warpath.

Mayday Mayday, raise the white flags, time for the payday,
Payday, and it's like that, out shit is World Wide, North, South, East,
And West, put on your shield, lets see who's the best. Repeat 1x

(Verse 2: Mr. Voo-Doo)

You feel the burnin' emission
You squirm in submission
No terms and conditions
Y'all confirm my suspicions
That y'all are bitches that resemble Men
Like female Tennis players at Wimbledon
Why you tremblin'?
Shook like the ricter
My voice raise waves
And make y'all change ways like crooks turnin' Muslim
Blast shots burnin' your Bosom
Like bitch cramps
You got lucky your people told you switch camps
Or get damp with plenty led
I'm like a beast with many heads
Sort of like the Predators dreads
I got more arms than Dr. Octavious
Rock your whole block radius
I be the bomb
And I bleed nitrogliceren if you slice my palm
The Don been gone for how long from the rap biz?
Wet more domes than John the baptist
When the gat spits
It ain't over till the last man's limbs
Are twisted like he was doin' Yoga
In fact my Pistol's longer than the Jokers
I ignite Mag's
Leave your toe wearin' a white tag
So, y'all niggas better raise the white flag.

(Verse 3: L-Swift)

I swear there's a war in the air in the New York streets
You talk beef?
You had a swollen Melon, now you humble
With loaded weapons, nowhere to run to
We mega high, jet in the sky, droppin' bombs,
Prepare to crumble as we rock on,
Beware of the jungle with Anaconda's
Don't puff too much 'cause the enemy smells the Marijuana
We blastin' every object in Combat with honor
So yo, remember the agenda with the plan of action
No retreat, no surrender, keep the cannons blastin'
We blastin' heat till each member turns into has-beens
Soldiers bangin', who's click'll get done?
My crew can taste victory at the tip of the tongue
Always prepared physically, take the clip for the gun
And put it in, 'cause when it's on how many niggas'll run?
You said we couldn't win, bullets in ya flesh, cave in your chest
You pullin' for breath, I'm claimin' your death
You shouldn't've stepped, war paint on my chest
Fatigue green and black
And the heat reacts
To make you bleed like hemophiliacs
See me strapped, heavily armed, repetitively
Releasin' caps till the enemy's gone, definitely
My people pack metal for me, let a legend be born
I declare war, (What mothafucka!) and it's on."

And I don't think that I could face it all again

And I no longer doubt
You've touched my heart and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid

solo la defensa de mi pobre vida

porque soy un ganador

pero en el 59 aunque iba muy atento
una mano amiga me rapi√±√≥ el vento

sin tener en cuenta que andaba cesante
y por andar pensando en esas cosas distra√≠do
no vi ni la sombra de ese colectivo.

And leave that up to my niggas, young fly niggas

I changed my mind I don't want your bitch
'Cause sorry ass women just don't get rich
You could keep her
I'd rather have a fifi bag because it's cheaper
You can't come up for NL
I gets deeper
And my hold is so cold, it's a sleeper
So pass the reafer
And to you false balling niggas just grab your crotches
But if you paid nigga pat your pockets

Somebody play the potato
Let's take a ballad
On who gonna invite the hoes that make the party valid
'Cause we don't need a whole crib full of dudes again
And here come the police with them big black boots again
Kicking niggas out
Hand cuffing and stuffing they banging jacky chicken in they mouth
And time to shine pitching a fit
'Cause somebody rolled her bud in a heeny blunt and won't pass the shit
Who keeps turning the lights on?
Why the music keep skipping?
And why these dirty khaki niggas tripping?
I don't know I'm Quik and I'm still delighted
500 dollars worth of white star
About to hide it
'Cause y'all ain't drinking mine up
You better drink that anj and palmason and the rest of that wine up
You party haters need to stop it
I think we really about to pat your pockets

Hey baby
My girlfriend left me today
So which one of you old ragedy ass bitches wanna come in here and play?
That's what my homie told and try to cop the cancun
Then I caught him in there hunching in my downstairs bathroom
And in the kitchen and up in there on the dancefloor
By the big screen TV where your pants go?
Some of you niggas I swear
I try to throw y'all a ragedy ass party
And y'all don't even care
Cigarette burns in my plush
Empty beer bottles in the brush
And my bitch acting like a lush
Boy what else could go wrong?
Somebody kick the extension cord out

In the name of the fold, the name of the sold, I became Rome's slave 

Dumnorix, I did quite weep when I betrayed us all 
To save us all at the threshold of our demise 
Be my penance, be my nemesis 
For I sold my soul... 

In the name of Gallia - welcome me, ferryman
In the name of my greed - welcome me, ferryman
In the name the Gauls, in the name of the kneeled 
In the name of the fold, the name of the sold, I came to die"

And found poor Billie gone)

It's so nice that we all get along so well

Where are you Love? 
Yesterday I looked for you... 
on the floor, and in the sky, Dearest... 
and I didn't find you. 
I can't think that you're hiding from me 
Because my silence is sincere... 
It says 'yes' 
Where are you Love? 
Come, return for me... 
that my life knots like an eight... 
if you're not here.. 
I want to think... 
that you won't falter... 
because on this planet, no one else exists that I could love. 
Chorus: 
Where are you Love? 
I looked for you yesterday 
WHere are you Love? 
And I didn't find you 

Where are you Love? 
You left here.. 
Looking for who-knows what... 
so far from me... 
and I can think.... 

and continue to think... 
that you won't falter 
because on this planet.. 
no one else exists... 
that I could possibly love. 
(Repeat Chorus) 

I looked for you 
in the wardrobe 
In the phone book 
under the car 
in black and in white 
in History books 
in magazines 
and on the radio. 
I searched for you in the streets 
You're Mother's 
A bootmaker's stand(?) 
In my change purse 
In two thousand religions 
I've even looked for you in my songs"

There's no beginning, there'll be no end
'Cause on my love you can depend

I see your face before me
As I lay on my bed
I kind'a get to thinking
Of all the things you said

You gave your promise to me
And I gave mine to you
I need someone beside me
In everything I do (oh yes I do)

Concealed from the view
Hidden from the knowledge of Men
A little kind through trees it lives
Nymphs of dark and lust
""Fairy of bad fate!""
Somebody tells he has seen
Some of the little ones
Some even that have talked with them
So nice and handsome
""Please, don't be such a fool!
Tell everyone that the witches come tonight""

Desire grows, denial howls
Your will has gone
""Divine the wicked multitude
Worship your servitude""
Enthroned and ringed with gold
Of the mighty old oak
I'm on the lightness side

Daughters and sons
There are times to carry on,
All my life for you
Keep on singing my tale
Deny the Trows kind
Don't you dare to stay behind?
Through years and centuries,
Through myth and poetry
Our race's slowly dying
In the heart of mankind

Deep in the woods
They're dressed with the fruits of earth
Arcane adorers of the roots
Dance Henking tonight
""Fairy of bad fate!""
Vanishing through branches
Followeed by the Redcaps
They're greddy for silver and gold

(Bridge and chorus)

Trapped in a web of branches and leaves dead
You hear voices reciting a prayer...
Come nearer and see!
""Hare hare good sent the care
I am in a haire likeness, just see me there
But I shall be in a woman's likeness soon"""

I don't eat no meat.
No dairy, no sweets.
Only ripe vegtables, fresh fruit and whole wheat.
I'm from the old school, my household smells like soul food, bro.
Curry falafel, barbequed tofu.
No fish, or none of dem candy bars.
No ciggarettes.
Only ganja, and fresh squeezed juice from oranges.
Excerisin' daily, to stay healthy.
An I rarely drink water out the tap 'cause it's filthy.

Lentil soup - is- mental fruit
And, ginger root- is good for the youth.
Fresh vegetables with the ital stew.
Sweet yam fries with the green caleoo
Careful how you season and prepare your foods,
Cause you don't want to lose - vitamins and minerals
And that's the jewel-
Life brings.
Life is valuable, so I eat what comes from the ground- It's natural.
Let your food be your medicine. No exceteran.
Strictly herb, generates from the sun.
'Cause I got MELANIN.
Drink water. 8 glasses a day.
Cause that's what they say.

They say you are what you eat.
So I strive to eat healthy.
My goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy.
Cause true wealth, comes from good health and wise ways.
That's why we gotta start takin' better care of ourselves.

Be Healthy Y'all.

I never had the time to try
Now you say it's over

Is it a sin, to love again?
You broke me in
This won't repair

And yes I fell for you so madly deeply
And yes I want to hold you by my side
Now you say it's over

Forgot to tell you I am sorry
Never had the time to lie
Now it's like a sad old story
Why do lovers always cry
I never had the time to worry
I never had the time to try
Now you say it's over
And now you say it's over

And yes I want to tell you I am angry
And yes I need to look you in the eye
Cause you said it's over

Forgot to tell you I am sorry
Never had the time to lie
Now it's like a sad old story
Why do lovers always cry
I never had the time to worry
I never had the time to try
Now you say it's over
Now you say it's over
Now you say it's over

Woman speaking in background (from ""Rip Van Winkle"" by Washington Irving):

""Times grew worse and worse with Rip Van Winkle as years of matrimony rolled on; a tart tempter never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue is the only edge tool that grows keener by constant use. For a long while he used to console himself, when driven from home, by frequenting a kind of perpetual club of the sages, philosophers, and other idle personages of the village, which held its sessions on a bench before a small inn, designated by a rubicund portrait of his majesty George the Third. Here they used to sit in the shade, through a long lazy summer's day, talking listlessly over village gossip, or telling endless sleepy stories about nothing. But it would have been worth any statesman's money to have heard the profound discussions that sometimes took place, when by chance an old newspaper fell into their hands, from some passing traveller. How solemnly they would listen to the contents, as drawled out by Derrick Van Bummel, the schoolmaster, a dapper learned little man, who was not to be daunted by the most gigantic word in the dictionary..."""

Wonders if he's really lost his one joy.

Only place she ever went to lose herself,
She's gone to the movies now and she,
Don't need your help.

Now the rain turns into snowfall as the,
City sky reflects the silver street below,
And it covers up the cars,
And the Wall-flowers CD ended half an hour ago.

Another fool would dig the broken car out from the snow,
And drive to find the show,
She's gone to the movies now and she's,
Not coming home,
She's gone to the movies now and she's,
Not coming home.

Now he looks around his place and anyways,
There's nowhere she could sit besides the bed,
And he wonders if the car will start tomorrow,
Or he'll have to take the bus instead.

Any other fool would be out on the roadway,
Trying to spot her rusted Pontiac,
She's gone to the movies now and she's,
Not coming back,
She's gone to the movies now and she's,
Not coming back."

The seers and the prophets had foretold it long ago
That the long awaited one would make men stumble
But they were looking for a king to conquer and to kill
Who'd have ever thought He'd be so weak and humble
He will be the truth that will offend them one and all
A stone that makes men stumble
And a rock that makes them fall
Many will be broken so that He can make them whole
And many will be crushed and lose their own soul
Along the path of life there lies a stubborn Scandalon
And all who come this way must be offended
To some He is a barrier, To others He's the way
For all should know the scandal of believing
It seems today the Scandalon offends no one at all
The image we present can be stepped over
Could it be that we are like the others long ago
Will we ever learn that all who come must stumble"

All the curtains are drawn and the windows stay closed
She's got pictures and paint that she never used
She's not so much angry as hurt and confused

When her husband comes home after working so late
They both try to be strong for the other one's sake
And they talk about things that don't matter at all
And neither one mentions what's right down the hall

In the room where a cradle holds nothing but questions
And the rocking chair waits in the dark
Where the laughter is silent and the silence is louder
Than even the cries of their heart
Though their faith is strong and they still believe
In what only the Lord can do
They hold to each other and wait for the day
When they can finally go in the room

Though is seems like that have everything in their life
They're not mother and dad, but still husband and wife
As they live with the pain and conceal all the scars
They're close to each other, but they're never too far

From the room where a cradle holds nothing but questions
And the rocking chair waits in the dark
Where the laughter is silent and the silence is louder
Than even the cries of their heart
Though their faith is strong and they still believe
In what only the Lord can do
They hold to each other and they wait for the day
When they can finally go in the room

There's a light in the hallway that's calling
To a place where the dream finds release
In knowing their Heavenly Father is holding the key

To the room where a cradle holds nothing but questions
And the rocking chair waits in the dark
Where the laughter is silent and the silence is louder
Than even the cries of their heart
And though their faith is strong and they still believe
In what only the Lord can do
They'll hold to each other and they'll wait for the day

In silence veiled, her withered cheek
A childhood queen without a throne
My dreamless sleeping child
Red sorrows grinning through my veins
My voice unheard, unseen the tears
I'm waiting where the moonsun reigns
My garden whispers tunes
Hear my voice and drink my tears
I await you with firetunes
Veiled in everlasting silence
But once your heart was full of tunes
As we danced as one with the dryads of July
Ashra
Autumnal storms of endless grey
The harvester will sorrow reap
You saw the spring, the spring in May
Mein Feuerlilienstern
Hear my voice...
Wenn Wesen, die die Sonne schuf
In Schlaf und Weltennacht versinken
Wenn ungeh√∂rt verhallt mein Ruf
Will ich den Kelch des Todes trinken
Remember my voice and sink in your soul
I wove you a solar crown"

There is a song, taken far by the winds

A rhyme of poets, a melody
Wrapped in a dream
The elvensong has gone, to another realm

Stand before the new born kind

As young and fresh as the Spring in bloom
The song is telling stories
Every little is a gain
Tells of joy, it tells of pain

Pathfinders... searching for new scents
We are pathfinders!

Rulers of a reign without throne and
Crown ""Thou will shall be done!""
Beyond our bounds
Wondering, seeking and roaming
The unbeaten paths
Face future learning from the past

Lay down no bounds
To the things you can do
Everything's in your hand,
Look up to the Moon
All we are gathering, shall we not fall
We'll hold (we'll hold on)
We will meet again
This time my dear old friend

Singing our song, we went abreast
We plunged into a deeply cloven track
May the stars shine
Upon the end of road, now you can't tide

Stand before the new born kind

As young and fresh as the Spring in bloom
The song is telling stories
Every little is a gain
Tells of joy, it tells of pain

Pathfinders... searching for emotions
We are pathfinders!

Rulers of a reign without throne and
Crown ""Thou will shall be done!""
Beyond our bounds

Face future learning from the past

To the things you can do

Look up to the Moon
All we are gathering, shall we not fall
We'll hold (we'll hold on)
We will meet again
This time my dear old friend

If you can't express what you feel within
Remember not only words can speak
If a pen killed more than sword
Let this tune be your own word!

A new journey begins each time

You draw lotsfor new things to find
We are willing to endure the chance

Please fasten your seatbelts in the interest of safety
Atlanta welcomes you to come witness the light
What you've been waitin for this fine Saturday night
Yes, that's right, come one, come all
Through the boondocks to all suburban shopping malls
Trailer parks, the PJs, country clubs, and ghettos
This is your Saturday night special

It's Saturday and the club smells like cigarettes and aftershave
Survival of the fittest, we're the last remaining castaways
Crack the stage, tear the roof off and collapse the place
A new breed of emcee with characteristics of a master race
Captivated, you can't recall who those others are
Make you drop to your knees and thank god you paid the cover charge
Love is hard to listen to, 'cause we're softly killing
It's been a long time since you've had feelings this original
Second nature like breathing slow for those like Ishmael
The bases that you need to know, we supply the remedy
Each cypher is a china shop, we break porcelain figurines
The mic is a weapon and you've got suicidal tendencies
Stammer and stutter through your twenty minute train wreck
The 9 to 5 is right here with or without a paycheck
You're like a sure thing, disconnect is a safe bet
Wait a sec, just heard you hit record on your tape deck
Call your local DJ and make him put it on repeat
This song is the reason Americans practice free speech
When The Source has less street cred than Teen Beat
Every weekend shut it down and listen up when we speak

It was love in the club
There's thugs in the club
There's drugs in the club
But it's bugged that the club
Is home for those that ripping like us
We got your hands in the air, yelling while you slapping your vertebrae
Saturday night special like a snub nosed thirty eight
So click, bow! mix six shots for hip-hop
We're goin' state to state with this, so your city is just a pit stop
Or for however long my set is
I'ma rep this from georgia to California to jersey back down to Texas
A real emcee don't rely on marketing the gimmicks
When I told him to stop writing, I was targeting the mimics
So make some noise for me and Manchild and of course there's Dust
Raise your voices up, and enjoy the rush
You can trust that we gonna gonna give you what you came for, and a little bit more
Something for you to spend your change on when it finally hits stores
I might battle before or after the show or after I flow
We gonna know that I'm official like the tag in the store, yeah

(ManCHILD)
I'm passing this accurate round forth and back radical sound
It's me and greed the time for action is now

Smacking clowns and think you're backin us down
You bound to get it first
We keep it fresh like your mouth after chewin some Cinnaburst

(ManCHILD)
Yeah I spit a verse I wrote today I can't wait till the ink settles
Bring it through the blinking lights, broken dreams, and drink specials

You think bezzles and chains will define you as an emcee
But if you rhyme after I'm finished shining the club gonna be empty

(ManCHILD)
To put it simply, this is life and living it is on you
Giving y'all the means to be limitless if you want to

But I warn you, this is a about as real as it gets
To make it in this takes patience like dealing with kids

(ManCHILD)
Right, and I can't spare the rod because effectively we change the pace
Save the face of music on weekends plus the labor days

In a major way this is the way we play the game
So say the name, issues with Mars Ill still spitting these waves of flames

(ManCHILD)
We chain gang bound together breaking what surrounds me
Maybe some day you'll be blessed to find our presence in your county

She is everything I want that I never knew I needed 

It's all up in the air
And we stand still
To see what comes down 
I don't know where it is
I don't know when,
But I want you around 
When it falls into place
With you and I
We go from if to when 
Your side and mine
Are both behind
It's indication 

This is going to bring me clarity 
This'll take the heart right out of me 

She is everything I need that I never knew I wanted 
She is everything I want that I never knew I needed 
She is everything I need that I never knew I wanted 
She is everything I want that I never knew I needed 

This is going to bring me to my knees 
I just want to hold you close to me

Totally unblue

Don't go knockin' on my door
Gotta stay away for sure
You say you miss me like crazy now
But I ain't buyin' that
You better get off my back
Don't go knockin' on my door

I can see
It's no mystery
It's so clear to me
That we had is all history
It's ok
I can sleep at night.
It will be all right
I can hear myself saying,
I am better off without you

Okay, it's time for some action
A little passion, some booty waxin'
For the bozac, make sure he's strapped
And if baby got back, then yo, we with that
Call up a few people on the phone
Yo we're havin' a party, at my private home
Some bring some chronic, plus some brew
Call up your girl and invite her too
Come active and bring purple lactives
'Cause we're gonna get more busy than gymnastics
And do the humpty hump all night
So when you come with the boy, make sure you're right
It's nine o'clock, party starts at ten
So enough for now, I'll talk to you then
Later, huh, I'll see you when you get here
And make it quick, ah yeah
Time for some safe sex

Ding dong, there goes the bell
I opened up the door and oh, what the hell
It was a buncha niggas standin' by my door
I said come in, but respect my floor
That means take off your shoes and englands
'Cause I'm a gentleman, some say distinguished
All of y'all put your things up in the kitchen
And the rest of y'all sit down and listen
Be free and relax in what you're wearin'
Let's all be happy like Bobby McFerrin
And get loose and produce the funky juice
And let's swing this shit like they swing a forty deuce
They want some reggae, like some flex
Time to have sex
And it's all night, so turn off the light
And let's get high as a kite
And have safe sex

Somebody say sex (sex)
Say safe sex (safe sex)
I love it (I love it)
I need it (I need it)

But for real, when you're havin' sex
No matter what type, make sure you wear the latex
To all of the cons out there sexin'
Stop and look, boy, you're stressed out protection
Cause aids is real and something to believe
Or not make-believe and fake like hair weave
A death wish like Charles Bronson
And if you don't believe me then ask Magic Johnson

The more we stay the same

And it seems to me now like I'm the center of the universe

Hey! look at me!

But I say it's just this missile in my vein
It comes on hard, there's no stop no start
And it kicks so strong, the kick goes on
Over and over till you can't belong,
It's an endless song
One, two, three, it goes on

And you're just another weirdo

Yet stops to etch the fingerprints
Upon a baby's hand
Would you believe the mighty God

Would condescend to be a friend

There is nothing else to know
Now my words are gone

Needing you tonight
As I am walking through the desert of your eyes
Let addiction be my rope to get away from here
Come to me tonight
Now my body is craving power to survive to make sorrow disappear and
Drift
In ecstasy

Long lost in the wishing well
Hu!

Take a ride on the wild side
Wild side

Fallen angels so fast to kill
Thy kingdom come on the wild side
Our father who ain't in heaven
Be thy name on the wild side
Holy Mary, mother may I
Pray for us on the wild side
Wild side
Wild side

Name dropping no-names
Glamorize cocaine
Puppets with strings of gold
East L.A. at midnight
Papa won't be home tonight
Found dead with his best friend's wife

Take a ride on the wild side
Wild side

Take a ride on the wild side
Wild side

Gang fights, fatal strikes
We lie on the wild side
No escape, murder, rape
Doin' time on the wild side
A baby cries, a cop dies
A day's pay on the wild side
Wild side
Wild side
Tragic life on the wild side
Wild side
Wild side
Kickin' ass on the wild side"

I'm fitted for a heat-resistant sleeve
Keep your distance please
Your persona's in question my phosphorescent skin
Makes your heat pistons freeze
I'm a hallucinogen pez-dispenser, led ventures
With a group of umpla-lumpa parachute troopers
Who discredit theories and behead your mentors
Who can radio wave windsurf to invert what is common knowledge
I will insert my solemn promise to style until my limbs burst
Negotiate with marketing consultants, giving me the once-over
Wearing grim smirks
They would like me to convert my gritty edge
To unearth my earning potential
But my face is so sun burnt
Due to all the grassroots grunt work
That I won't be co-opted
And every photo-op needs to be photoshopped cropped and snipped
But I'm a street vendor kinds sir
This style-free is dopamine
It's a meat tenderizer at the gallery opening

You can join my suicide cult
Membership is free
Take these cyanide eye-drops
And peppermint hemlock
This is what you have been billed for
Dancing on the kill floor
To vibrant woofer, clients butchered to a film score
This is what you have been killed for
Dancing on the kill floor
To vibrant woofer, clients butchered to a film score

Contrast bohemia to my workplace
When I'm racing in carpool lane
To sell shit to an art school lame
-Don't you think you're hot shit
Well what do you have to offer-
A dead archetype able to be purchased on a credit card swipe
But they can they pinpoint and nail
My distance between art and commerce
With just an invoice of a sale
I will disappoint an ail
Those who want to deny us the majority rule
When a will jump in my primordial pool
Without knowing where their swim trunks were
But not everyone knows
What they're called on to encumber
You can't know by just logging on with a pin number
Buy now
You pasty Brits
Buy now
You crazy chicks
Buy
'Cause I don't pay attention to rules,
Regulations or safety tips
Love us
Eligible bachelors
Love us
'Cause we're the Blowed rappers
Loved
'Cause I tour the country so much
I can do it blindfolded with no road atlas
Unrelated to your three-legged
Preachy bootleggers will do away with you
CD duplicators make vegans
Do the salad bar swing-pivot
Wave your valid parking tickets
At the endangered sea-urchin
Tell me the name of your political activist key person
And I'll tell you what's under the blips of the clean version
Of the infamous rap rant
Trickling down the baggy pant leg
Of this unhappy class aid
Covered in shell fragments of this
Graffiti tagged glass egg
I can sell anything to a hip-hopper
Like it's my cathartic something
But I don't make enough to go apartment hunting

You can dance to death
And for no extra charge
Give me your debit card
So you can have sex with stars
This is what you have been billed for
Dancing on the kill floor
To vibrant woofer, clients butchered to a film score

Break out the winter clothes
And find a love to call your own
You - enter you
Your cheeks a shade of pink
And the rest of you in powder blue

Who knows what will be
But I'll make you this guarantee

See
No way November will see our goodbye
When it comes to December it's obvious why
No one wants to be alone at Christmas time

In the dark, on the phone
You tell me the names of your brothers
And your favorite colors
I'm learning you
And when it snows again
We'll take a walk outside
And search the sky
Like children do

I'll say to you
No way November will see our goodbye
When it comes to December it's obvious why
No one wants to be alone at Christmas time

And come January we're frozen inside
Making new resolutions a hundred times
February, won't you be my valentine?
And we'll both be safe 'til St. Patrick's Day

We should take a ride tonight around the town
And look around at all the beautiful houses
Something in the way that blue lights
On the black night can make you feel more
Everybody, it seems to me, just wants to be
Just like you and me

No one wants to be alone at Christmas time
Come January we're frozen inside
Making new resolutions a hundred times
February, won't you be my valentine?

And if our always is all that we gave
And we someday take that away
I'll be alright if it was just 'til

Spoken:
Dre, just let it run.
Hey yo, turn the beat up a little bit
Hey yo, this song is for anyone... fuck it, just shut up and listen
Hey yo

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences gettin' this stress
That's been eatin' me recently off of this chest

And I rest again peacefully (peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter

To not come and speak to me (speak to me)
I don't know you and no, I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-ing thing
I'm not Mr. *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick

If you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet (10 feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you

Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of arguin' (of arguin)
I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be, it's just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content.
That song ""Guilty Conscience"" has gotten such rotten responses.""

And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinky

Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school

And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see an upper class city

Havin' this happenin' (this happenin' )
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name Is""

And pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
That copped me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)
To deal with these cocky caucasians

Who think, I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?

The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
Till I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (ahhh)
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (me crazy)
I can't take it, I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am

Will all come true

I belong to you

There is nothing I won't do for you
I know my soul connected me to you
I feel so safe when I'm alone with you
I'm holding back nothing
Saving it all for you

It's like a high I can't come down from you

I walked to the fertile crescent and built
The sphinx
I designed a pyramid so tough that a star
That only glows every one hundred years falls
Into the center giving divine perfect light
I am bad

I sat on the throne
Drinking nectar with allah
I got hot and sent an ice age to Europe
To cool my thirst
My oldest daughter is nefertiti
The tears from my birth pains
Created the nile
I am a beautiful woman

I gazed on the forest and burned
Out the sahara desert
With a packet of goat's meat
And a change of clothes
I crossed it in two hours
I am a gazelle so swift
So swift you can't catch me

For a birthday present when he was three
I gave my son hannibal an elephant
He gave me rome for mother's day
My strength flows ever on

My son noah built new/ark and
I stood proudly at the helm
As we sailed on a soft summer day
I turned myself into myself and was
Jesus
Men intone my loving name
All praises All praises
I am the one who would save

I sowed diamonds in my back yard
My bowels deliver uranium
The filings from my fingernails are
Semi-precious jewels
On a trip north
I caught a cold and blew
My nose giving oil to the arab world
I am so hip even my errors are correct
I sailed west to reach east and had to round off
The earth as I went
The hair from my head thinned and gold was laid
Across three continents

I am so perfect so divine so ethereal so surreal
I cannot be comprehended except by my permission

I mean... I... can fly
Like a bird in the sky..."

And when you wake up in the morning give yer momma a kiss
Then I had to say goodbye
In the morning woke momma with a kiss on each eyelid

Held me like I was made of gold

I defend my dad he's the best of all men
And whatever he's doing he's doing the right thing
It's frightening, but it makes me mad
Why do all of these people seem to hate my dad?
And if that ain't enough now I get these spots
I go to sleep every night with my stomach in knots
And what's more, I can hear momma next door
Explore the radio for reports of war
And all we ever seem to do is hide the tears
Seems like daddy been gone for years

This scenario is happening everywhere
And you ain't going to nirvana or far-vana
You're coming right back here to live out your karma

Just how many centuries have we been waiting for someone else to make us free?
And we refuse to see
That people overseas suffer just like we
Bad leadership and ego's unfettered and free
Who feed on the people they're supposed to lead

For the lord to make it all straight

Scenes from all romantic prose while tethered to the roles
Or what was meant disguised as sentiment could hang
Misunderstood and left unanswered

Your eyes tell me I have what I wanted
Haunted as I hold you
Nervous slacking with the lacking heartache
No heartbreak when I told you

And though I never did surrender could you please remember
If and when we meet again we once were more than friends
Embarrassed me but would you share a scene and kiss me
One last time before I leave you

And though I won't surrender I want you to remember
If and when we meet again we'll still be more than friends
Grant me this it could seem frivolous, but kiss me
One last time before I leave you

You've got all my loving in a tangle
That I could never undo
You will never hear me singing la la

Crying on the telephone.

I'm sure its safe to say you've seen your better days...

You must have heard what everyone said,

But don't you let it go to your head.

The backseat is just a luxury you could not afford.

Because everyone has figured you out...

So think before you open your mouth...

The next words you say could incriminate and leave a chance for them to burn you at the stake.
So sit back and relax, chew up the scenery.

Let the people see what you wanted them to believe.

Because I don't care if you sink or if your ship wrecks,

I will only assume it was because of me...

So don't hold your breath...

(An apology is not something I would expect)

Don't take that step

(Don't cross that line there might not be anything left)

You might lower your standards for a night or two.

Your best excuse is there was nothing left to do.

You were so desperate and dried out that one kiss is all it took to ignite the fuse...
Now that I've got your attention.

With a simple slide of hand and the honest intention to,

To make you fall.

Here's to the idea of living through it all...

So quiet now...

Don't say a word...

This will all be over soon if I don't get my medicine.

Then you can phone the doctor and tell him what a mess I've been...

As you wake up on the bathroom floor nothing could've mattered more than finding your way back home...

So brush your knees and quietly leave, don't promise me you won't promise me anything...

An apology is not something I could do."

As the evening sky grew dark
She looked at him and he felt a spark
Tingle to his bones
'Twas then he felt alone
And wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate

They walked alone by the old canal
A little confused, I remember well
And stopped into a strange hotel
With a neon burning bright
He felt the heat of the night
Hit him like a freight-
Train moving with a simple twist of fate

A saxophone someplace far off played
As she was walking on by the arcade
As the light bust through a beat up shade
Where he was waking up
She dropped a coin into the cup
Of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate

He woke up; the room was bare
He didn't see her anywhere
He told himself he didn't care
Pushed the window open wide
Felt an emptiness inside
To which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate

He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks
Where the sailors all come in
Maybe she'll pick him out again
How long must he wait
One more time for a simple twist of fate

People tell me it's a sin
To know and feel too much within
I still believe she was my twin
But I lost the ring
She was born in spring
But I was born too late
Blame it on a simple twist of fate"

But I keep on staring...
(My world is over, close the door)

Her skin reflects behind the blur
I'm intoxicated
Where am I from? Why am I here?
You're so predictable
Fingers running through my hair
I'm a new addiction
She steps out from her underwear

Yet He could stop a rising storm
With a gesture of His hand
But He chose to use His hands to heal
Hearts of darkness, hearts of stone
Just like mine would be revealed

He was a man of no reputation
And by the wise, considered a fool
When He spoke about faith and forgiveness
In a time when the strongest arm ruled
But this man of no reputation
Loved the weak with relentless affection
And He loved all those poor in spirit
Just as they were
He was a man of no reputation

It was said this man brought only confusion
That He'd achieve his ends by any means
And the truth would bring revolution
Well, for once they were right
The truth set us free
The hearts of the captive were his only concern
And the powerful knew their days were ending

He was a man of no reputation
And by the wise, considered a fool
When He spoke about faith and forgiveness
In a time when the strongest arm ruled
But this man of no reputation
Loved the weak with relentless affection
And He loved all those poor in spirit
Just as they were
He was a man of no reputation

One day soon the gates of heaven will open wide
And the Prince of Peace will come back for His bride

He was a man of no reputation
And by the wise, considered a fool
When He spoke about faith and forgiveness
In a time when the strongest arm ruled
But this man of no reputation
Loves the weak with relentless affection

Living in a hole
Since I lost my girl

Would you dance in the dirt
Come home way past daybreak
Cockleburs all stuck in your shirt
Come back home to twilight
Come back home to me
Subterranean river you are
Meets the molten sea

Nigga did whatever it took to get in nigga
From the jackin', to the rappin', to the slangin' crack and...

First Verse:

X-Raided up in this bitch, bout to disrupt some shit,
Ain't from the pound, but I'm still down to Kurupt some shit,
Interrupt your shit, 'cause I'm always in a rush to spit,
Like an axe, when I rap, I splitter up your clique,
You better relax, be a witness or a participant,
Eddie Gaffin' laughin' at the CO, wonder where the Sergeants went,
See we flow, but it's way more bigger than that,
Ransom note, deliver the gats and all them wack ass tracks,
So we slit his throat, it's malicious, but the game's vicious,
And niggas know, we'll do anything that gains us riches,
We quick to flow, but we just as quick to bark that heat,
Start that beef and Dott Dogg will pause that heartbeat,
We hard to beat, like Schwarzanegger in movies bout factual
Burning niggas like third degree,
Critical surgery,
When I'm mad, you hoes burglary, intrudin' your home,
Stole everything like clepto includin' your dome,
Left your ass chewed up, gaze blast, mid-section blew up,
Bet you all five homicide detectives threw up,
Suit up, in coca sacks then I smoke a bag,
They make me get my focus back, then I choke the gat

When it came to gettin' that money I did whatever it took,
Fuck dividin' the power, wanted every cranny and nook,
Understand me nigga, my family is full of thugs and crooks,
Kings and queens protected by knights, bishops, and rooks

Second Verse:

You better look into my eyes, can't you see the pain?
I'm tired of lies, bitches and niggas playin' games,
This is my ghetto prayer, Lord can you hear me?
Protect my family from player haters, don't let 'em near me,
No need to fear me, I'm only human,
Pursuin' dreams for greenbacks with more schemes, than J.R. Ewing,
I mean that sincerely,
Love my alcohol and tetrahydracanebanol dearly,
Consumin' twenty pounds yearly,
Clearly I'm out for the cash, nothin' else in my vision,
Takin' chances, makin' decisions that could keep me in prison,
But circumstances keep demandin' me to break these laws,
Writin' lyrics strong enough to, penetrate these walls,
Dott Dogg, don't feel I'm guilty,
As charged, I'm filthy really,
Down for the cause, and I'm comin' raw till they kill me feel me,
With slugs to the dome, ain't no love so it's on,
And if you ain't thuggin' with me nigga, then I'm thuggin' alone,
I'm a ruggish bone like Bizzy, Wish, Krayzie, Layzie and Flesh
Art of War to the last breath, nigga ride to the death,
We hardcore, Dott Dogg and Nefarious,
Mad man, Black Market till they bury us

Third Verse:

I'm constricted on y'all ass like a python,
I'm ready to spit some venom, turn this mic on,
Run up in em,
Checkin' them niggas like a chess board,
'Cause they be hatin', what'cha think I sport a vest for?
Premeditatin',
Yes Lord I got my eye on'em,
When they try to get me I'ma have a fat surprise for 'em,
Got some advice for 'em,
You better recognize, Raided ain't down for none of that bullshit,
Got a full clip, and this man eater won't hesitate to pull it,
And deliver the bullets to your chest like a mailman droppin' off letters,
Fat hole in your sweater,
Smash out with all your cheddar,
Met a nigga that had much game, deeper than the abyss,
Taught me such thangs as how to get fame and keepin' cash in my fist,
Now I insist to get my scrilla scratch,
How real is that?
And I'm quick to peel a niggas cap,
Is you feelin' that?
Move swiftly when I see the cops, 'cause I ain't scrillin',
Muthafuckas wanna see me drop, but I ain't willin',
You a pawn in my book,
Busta market a hook,
Saw the fear in your eyes the first time that I looked,
I'ma treat y'all niggas like powdered cocaine it's time to get cooked,
I'm Michael Jordan, you the average guard about to get shook"
1934,TRATWYC12903CE60D6.h5,The Dillinger Escape Plan,Parasitic Twins,"I feel the world fall from the inside
It's coming down
My beating pulse crawls to a strange height
Please calm it down

I need a strong pull from your little lies
Or I'm going down
'Cause I built it all up from the inside
And you burned it down

'Cause when you took your love away
You let go

I feel the world fall from the inside
It's coming down

Although I miss you I'll never say I do
Bleed like the rain that's falling
Cut me through and through

I'd seen it all hiding in plain sight
And I held it down
But I'll give you all that you deserve tonight
'Cause you earned it when you burned me down

'Cause when you took your love away
You let go

I feel the world fall from the inside
It's coming down

Although I miss you I would never ever say I do
Bleed like the rain
Like the rain that falls upon my skin

Then you just gave our love away
You just let go

Then you just gave our love away
You just let go (You just let go, you just let go)

Bleed like the rain that falls upon my skin (Bleed like the rain that falls upon my skin)"

For a fake Chinese rubber plant
In the fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself

It wears her out

She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins

And it wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
It wears

She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run

And it wears me out

If I could be who you wanted

Angels descending bring from above
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love

This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long
This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long, all the day long

Perfect submission, all is at rest
I in my Savior am happy and blest
Watching and waiting, looking above
Filled with His goodness, filled with His goodness lost in His love

This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long
This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long, all the day long

Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!
This is my story, this is my song"
1966,TRAHWBP12903CAEBFC.h5,Dark Fortress,Evenfall,"With the dawn 
Comes the loathing 
With the morning 
Comes the fall 

With the qualm 
Come the vermin 
Come to spawn 
From the sun they crawl 

With the night 
Dies the calm 
With revulsion 
Comes the spite 

With the light 
Come the lightmares 
Waking Moloch 
Comes with the fall 

Succumb 
Withdraw your soul from this fallacy 
This infamy is not for us 

With the night 
Comes deliverance 
Comes the spark 
That sets us alight 

With the dark 
Comes remembrance 
Comes the halo 
Comes the flight 

And the ground takes a fall 

Torn upon winds of witchery 
Resplendent wings unfold 
Revelling in lucid lechery 
We invoke what no eye can behold 

Azure, her gaping portal 
I blaze in ecstasy 
The goddess calls, immortal 
Shrugs off all treachery 

Stay down 
Wait for evenfall 
For the night to embrace us again 
Wait for evenfall 

Sleep now 
Wait for evenfall 
For the abyss will set us free 
Wait for evenfall"

For giving us Your Son,
And leaving Your Spirit,

When I stand in Glory,
I will see His face,
And there I'll serve my King forever,
In that Holy Place.

I would not challenge a giant
I could not take on the church
Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose

I know a government man
He was as blind as the moon
He saw the sun in the night
He took a top-gun pilot
He made him fly through a hole
Till he grew real old
And he never came down
He just flew till he burst

Time will crawl till our mouths run dry
Time will crawl till our feet grow small
Time will crawl till our tails fall off
Time will crawl till the 21st century lose

I saw a black black stream
Full of white eyed fish
And a drowning man
With no eyes at all
I felt a warm warm breeze
That melted metal and steel
I got a bad migraine
That lasted three long years
And the pills that I took
Made my fingers disappear

Time will crawl, time will crawl
Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose

You were a talented child
You came to live in our town
We never bothered to scream
When your mask went on
We only smelt the gas
As we lay down to sleep

Time will crawl and our heads bowed down
Time will crawl and our eyes fall out
Time will crawl and the streets run red
Time will crawl till the 21st century lose

Time will crawl and our mouths run dry
Time will crawl and our feet grow small
Time will crawl and our tails fall off
Time will crawl till the 21st century lose

Time will crawl and our heads bowed down
Time will crawl and our eyes fall out
Time will crawl and the streets run red
Time will crawl till the 21st century lose

For the crazy child
We'll give every life
For the crackpot notion"

pon en mi cruz unas flores,
Dolores,
Y Dios te lo pagar√°.
No me niegues mi serrana el aguita para beber.
Ten piedad samaritana de lo amargo de mi ser.
¬øNo te da pena que llore?
Dolores,
¬øNo te da pena de mi?
Dame limosna de amores,
d√°mela tu mi Dolores
porque me voy a morir.

Yo no necesito tus pobres caudales,
ni quiero que cumplas aquel juramento;
me basta y me sobra que llores canales,
comido de pena y de remordimiento.
Pero lo que nunca jam√°s de la vida

es que hasta el momento que est√© en la agon√≠a
te habr√© de querer."

Tonight I just want you to see
I know I've never felt this way
And when you think everything's lost

If you could only see what I see then you'll want me too

With the ways of a gentleman I've been told
The kind of fellow that wouldn't even harm a flee

But if me and a certain character met
The guy that invented the cigarette
I'd murder that son-of-a-gun in the first degree

Cause, it ain't cause I don't smoke myself
And I don't reckon into your health
I've smoked them all my life and I ain't dead yet

But nicotine slaves are all the same
At a pettin' party or a poker game
Everything's gotta stop while they smoke the cigarette

Smoke, smoke, smoke that cigarette
Puff, puff, puff and if you smoke yourself to death

Tell St. Peter at the Golden Gate
That you hates to make him wait
You've gotta have another cigarette

In a game of chance the other night
Old Dame Fortune was doin' me right
The kings and the queens just kept on comin' around

I got a full and I bet 'em high
But my bluff didn't work on a certain guy
He just kept on raisin' and layin' that money down

He'd raise me, I'd raise him
I sweated blood, you gotta sink or swim
He finally called, didn't raise the bet

I said ""aces full pal, how 'bout you?""
He said ""I'll tell you in just a minute or two
Right now, I just gotta have myself a cigarette""

Smoke, smoke, smoke that cigarette
Puff, puff, puff and if you smoke yourself to death

Tell St. Peter at the Golden Gate
That you hates to make him wait
You've gotta have another cigarette

The other night I had me a date
With the cutest little gal on East 50 States
One 'em high-bred, uptown, fancy little dames

She said she loved me and it seemed to me
That everything's were like it oughta be
So hand in hand we strolled down lover's lane

She was oh so far from a chunk of ice
Our smoochin' party was goin' real nice
So help me, Hannah I'm thinking I've been there yet

I give her a kiss, a little squeeze
She said, ""Tex, excuse me please
But I just gotta have a filtered cigarette""

Smoke, smoke, smoke that cigarette
Puff, puff, puff and if you smoke yourself to death

Tell St. Peter at the Golden Gate
That you hates to make him wait
You've just gotta have another cigarette"

Talkin' 'bout the weekend, scrubbing off the dirt
Some heading home to their families, some are looking to get hurt
Some going down to Stovell wearing trouble on their shirts

I work for the county out on 95
All day I hold a red flag and watch the traffic pass me by
In my head I keep a picture of a pretty little miss
Someday mister, I'm gonna lead a better life than this

Working on the highway, laying down the blacktop
Working on the highway, all day long I don't stop
Working on the highway, blasting through the bedrock
Working on the highway, working on the highway

I met her at a dance down at the union hall
She was standing with her brothers, back up against the wall
Sometimes we'd go walking down the union tracks
One day I looked straight at her and she looked straight back

So I'm working on the highway, laying down the blacktop
Working on the highway, all day long I don't stop
Working on the highway, blasting through the bedrock
Working on the highway, working on the highway

I saved up my money and I put it all away
I went to see her daddy but we didn't have much to say
""Son, can't you see that she's just a little girl?
She don't know nothing about this cruel, cruel world""

We lit out down to Florida, we got along alright
One day her brothers came and got her and they took me in a black and white
The prosecutor kept the promise that he made on that day
And the judge got mad and he put me straight away

I wake up every morning to the work bell clang
Me and the warden go swinging on the Charlotte County road gang

I'm working on the highway, laying down the blacktop
Working on the highway, all day long I don't stop
Working on the highway, blasting through the bedrock
Working on the highway, working on the highway

Working on the highway, laying down the blacktop
Working on the highway, all day long I don't stop

The wonders of this world
Will never come with a match

She stays together strong as stone

She stops my rain, she calms my storm

And always knew just what to do

So many rely on her, I'm one of them and I know it
When demons haunt inside of her she fights hard not to show it

I've seen my girl forced to take
Pain, tragedy, and much heartache
The tears she hides, the smile she fakes
And through it all, she doesn't break

I don't know where she finds the strength
I'm only glad that she can
Just when I think my girl is down
She's on her feet again

She stops my rain, she calms my storm
Miracles she can perform
I've seen tough times, she's seen me through
And always knew just what to do

So many rely on her, I'm one of them and I know it
When demons haunt inside of her she fights hard not to show it

I've seen her world before my eyes
Get filled with evil, painful, spiteful lies
Still she fights, still she tries
And she will fight until she dies

Still she fights and still she tries

Liquor shot, if you happy and you know it

Doperhyming all worth it then

Acquired off the black market
Or wire tappin' couldn't target a jar split
The rapid fire spark lit

And it don't matter after
If they's a thug or a dapper

Plug yer trap or it's maximum exposure
The beast got family members asking 'em for closure

Aw, send 'em a gun an tell em clean it
Then go get the nun who said her son didn't mean it
She wore a filled-in thong, a billabong
And said, nah, fo'realla, the villain on a Gorilla jawn?

Something has started today
Where did he go? Why you want it to be?
Well you know, November has come
When it's gone away

At nine AM.

To keep my eyes still
Against the whole wide world
To make her love me.

No, that I'm not leavin' for anyone else, honey

Gather up my things
Leave the keys on the shelf
I'll come back in the morning
When the kids awake

To tell them daddy had to go away

I'm going far away
Nothing lasts forever
I'm going far from where I used to be
I remember that young couple at the chapel
It all seems like a dream to me

I!
I didn't know myself
Never knew myself when I met you
And even now must seem like a crime

You know that I promised to love you forever
It's just forever ran out of time

Know that I wanna

I'm gonna walk on

En todo el dia no voy a despertar
Para pensar que sigues a mi lado
Mi alma poco a poco se hundira 
En el abismo de los olvidados
Mi corazon prisionera sera
Conforme tu te vayas alejando

Regalame esta noche porfavor 
Te juro quisiera que no te fueras
Maldita perra suerte me toco
Quisiera que esta noche fuera eterna

Y solo una noche chiquitita!!!!
Vamos, hay!!!!

No quisiera volver a despertar
Y hundirme en un sueno muy profundo
Para sentir que tengo tu calor
Para sentir que tengo todo tuyo
Y juntos irnos a la eternidad
Y juntos alejarnos de este mundo

A veces resulta y muchas otras veces no.
Nos hicimos tantas cosas sucias sin raz√≥n
Y fue inevitable, nos rompimos el coraz√≥n.

Pero la ma√±ana llega igual
La gente arranca temprano,
Algunos mas otros menos
Es la ley de la vida, no se puede parar.

Todos fuimos puestos en la ruta del dolor,
Bicho que camina va a parar al asador.
Fuimos dos extra√±os as√≠ fue como empez√≥
Dimos tantas vueltas y al final no se quien sos.

Vamos a meternos en el mar,
La luna pega en el agua, hace calor en la playa
Vas surfeando las olas que el destino te da.

Y aunque hoy perdimos la se√±al
As√≠ es la ley de la vida, es una ruleta rusa
Hecha de cal y de arena, de principio y final.
Cada d√≠a mas confusi√≥n, una escandalosa prisi√≥n
Una jungla sin compasi√≥n, hecha de misterio y traici√≥n.

Nos clavamos los pu√±ales nena, por detr√°s,
Dejalo que sangre! Lo mejor es olvidar.
Sacate la careta baby, ya no actuemos m√°s
Lo que cura enserio las heridas es amar y cantar.

Esta es la tierra del oro y el sol,
Sangre, camino, desierto y calor.
Entre tu karma y la ley del tali√≥n
Asi es la ley de la vida mi amor

Ya se que no soy Tiberio gemelo ni vos Cal√≠gula,
Pero no te paso a buscar nunca m√°s con un Cadillac,
Ni los sue√±os nena, fuimos casi hermanos
Despu√©s pasaron mas de dos mil a√±os
Y hoy otra vez estamos en aquel mismo lugar."

Over what you are leaving,

Fall for what replaces
The things you were leading to
Love can take a turn
When you least expect it to
Me and you, me and you oh oh

Take what you get
Till you get what you want
Don't settle for
What you know to be wrong

Do you admit regret in times of doubt? (We will think for you.)
A life of gun in hand, with a dedication to your land,
Inside out you've shown it's not what life's all about.
No, we cannot believe in what you said,
When your whole life's been a sacrifice mislead.
But we still hold the pride.
When the gun smoke clears, we'll still salute you.
When you return by the tide, we'll be here to see your life through.
I'm confused and punctured. My conscience is my only means of direction.
Did I sign up for suicide, or a saddened bride?
Three more years, no white picket fencing, suffering a mental conviction.
Please, don't you think that now we will look down
On a man who's realized what's true to him now?
It's not giving up, it's seeing what else there's to see.
When you're soon set free, there is so much more than a camouflaged hell.
So cock the gun and fire into the eyes of a great desire.
A fleeting destiny has turned into what's considered to be normal.
And I'm here for you."

Oh, the beast is free

We drink and smoke and then

I could shield my eyes
From these inner most seductions
But still somehow you'll find me there
And why don't we say what we really feel?

Whenever things are at their best...
Whatever lies will help you rest
Whenever things are at their best...
Why do we wait for it to fall apart?

And it's probably safe to say
I'm not the world safest bet
I've never been too good at being good
And its probably safe to say...

Whenever things are at their best...
Whatever lies will help you rest
Whenever things are at their best...
Why do we wait for it to fall apart?

To my home town
I've been to yours many times before
And it's always been a thrill

You'll stay in a hotel
Or at friends near by
We haven't spent the night together in this town
Since nineteen seventy nine
Not such a long time

I can steal a melody
Of this I am allowed
'Cause you would never sue me baby
It wouldn't look good, it'd be weird

Have a drink after the show
I might really want to know
But everything you say I oppose
I blame it on my hole
It's just my role

I can steal a melody
Of this I am allowed
'Cause you would never sue me baby
It wouldn't look good, it'd be weird

I spend my time trying to forget you
With booze and smoke from cigarettes and dope
I only seem to forget myself
It's only you that is left

I can steal a melody
Of this I am allowed
'Cause you would never sue me baby

To live in memory
Of such an old lonesome time

I can't stop wanting you
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday.

Though long ago,
They still make me blue

They say that time
Heals a broken heart
But time has stood still

Funky fuckers

Erick Sermon:
Y'alll guess what the fuck is going on now
Me and Reggie Noble, making funk tunes around the global
Cause times keeps on slippin', and I get the funk from the kitchen
Then commits to ass whippin', there is no time for me to bust it
So I'm a chill and let Red get into a fly poetic justice

Redman:
Yo, it's all in the mind and I'm high and I kick it for the do or die
On 2 or 1 area code leavin' shit blown
Funkadelic is the one to bring the preacher out the teacher
When I feak 'em, ooh, yes y'all I got the mad method can you catch it?
And if your ear is not tuned in then ajust it

Erick Sermon:
Breaker 1-9, breaker 1-9 representin' today
Hey, Erick Sermons on the way
Dre gave me a ride so I Gangsta Lean while DRS will put the smoke in my
Chest
And if you understand me then escape and kick it
While the E-Double gets wicked with your brain twisted
It's going down, it's going way down
Go get the 4 pound and boogie down

Redman:
Boogie woogie to boogie to band boogie to that
My rap get mad dap on ass cracks and F it be on my ass cap
Cause my funk rolls thicker than Bisquick
If it's mixed with that same funky sticky shit I roll my splifs with
I shot the sheriff on the terris
And I kick the funk like these to have more off days than Ferris
Just wrote these raps up in the studio
Brothers can't tell and sisters can't hear me no (hear me hoe)

E got the funk, Red got the funk, Red got the funk, E got the funk (x2)

Erick Sermon:
Someone's knockin' at my door, yo Johnny Gill, I need the whole floor
So I can get busy remember? And if you don't call Michael Jackson
And don' be afraid to ask him, Erick Sermon got mad tunes
No matter what they say, I got more props than Richard Bay
The mind bogglin' with the hardcore followin'
So what's up, 'cause I don't give a fuck

Redman:
Whoa, I make you sing with Tony Braxton
I tear the shreads out of jams like stadiums when they packed in
Back up boy you messin' with the rude bwoy yes I told ya
I rock leather jacks with Tims, sweatpants one leg rolled up
Hold up! This is a stick up, I spark the izm with ? like a bizcut
1 and 2 skirts get lift up, E got the funk and Red got the funk
Pop the trunk, I get blocks of funk to make victims say ""That's the one!""
Of coarse I'm funky like fat people having intercorse
Basically the funk is stuck in your teeth so get the dental floss
Oh oh, freak out, 20 I know
But let me knock your teeth out
When I was young I turned my tree house into a weed house
And I'm deeper than Nostradomis, when I'm in chronic
And I leave your kitty cats meowin' home made bondage (meow)
Beeotch, trick, trick, beeotch

Ha ha ha. This is Dr. Trevis comin' to y'all motherfuckers with some more

Got the taste of cherry lipstick still a clinging to my mouth
She begged me not to leave her and she cried till I nearly stayed
But I glanced at that old roadmap and she just didn't make the grade
There wasn't nothing wrong with her lovin'
She just ain't got what they got down in Biloxi
I got a doll in Pascadola I got a jewel in Gulf Port
And both of them more warm blooded that any woman I've made up north
And it's a cajun queen in Creole she must be six feet tall
When she starts lovin' now you just gonna climb up the wall
Ain't nothin' against the other states they just ain't got what they got down in Biloxi
(Dobro)
When I reach the city limits I'm gonna stop upon the bluff
Nonchalantly get naked and go swimming in the gulf
Wash the north all off of me when I feel like it's done
I'm gonna crawl up on a rock and soak up all that southern sun
The sun shines in Minnesota but it don't shine like it do down in Biloxi
Then I'm going to missing persons I'm gonna turn my body in
And beg the police to shoot me if I try to leave again
Cause friend I've been all over and even looking at it from the worst

It's the same thing, back in the cold
People know people come and go it bores me
Same thing
Seems like I'm trapped in the world where the servants they serve time
Time waits on no man
So when people fall like me
I can't wait

Walking down blocks
Pictures don't stop
Pictures inside my dome
This is not me


I'm just afraid to be here all alone
Hurry up, wait
Quit it don't stop
I'm drowning in the self
This is not me
Where is my revolution, but
If you want to own me
I am not concerned
If you follow me
I know that I can learn
You might be the greatest thing I've ever seen
All I know is music
All, All I've ever known

'Cause I felt if I could know her
I would know all women

And they've not been any too well known
For brains and planning and organized thinking
But I'm sure the women are equal
And they may be ahead of the men

Yet I wouldn't spread such a rumor around
'Cause one organizes the other
And sometimes the most lost and wasted
Attract the most balanced and sane

And the wild and the reckless
Take up with the clocked and the timed
And the mixture is all of us
And we're still mixing

But never, never, never
Never could have it been done
If the women hadn't entered into the deal
Like she came along to me

And all creeds and kinds and colors
Of us are blending
Till I suppose ten million years from now
We'll all be just alike

Same color, same size
Working together
And maybe we'll have all of the fascists out of the way by then
Maybe so

But never, never, never
Never could have it been done
If the women hadn't entered into the deal
Like she came along to me"

May it never be contrary - may it never be at odds
May it always be forgiving - may it never know conceit
May it always be encouraged - may it never know defeat

We walked through the ice floes
To an unenduring land
Our future, our hope
There was something in the air,
The Age of the Unknown
Far beyond the sea of trees
The vision laid close

There's a place where the sun shines brighter
There's a mountain that climbs to the stars...

Day and night we built a reign
With heavenly desire
Sweat and dreams made up the bricks
That raised up our walls

Paying tribute to the gods
And blood kept on flowing
And the lust for knowledge
Was the sense of it all

Fly, fly to the stars,
Reach them on high
Bring back the answers of the night
Roll with the clouds,
Sing with the birds,
'Cause one day we'll have to say goodbye!

Here we go, carrying no longer sorrow
Standing up in the wind
Walk along, marching on for tomorrow
In this neverending way

Many years of harmony
The message arrived soon
Three big stars lined up together
A chill in the air...

The high-priest was dressed in black
On top of the stairways
Longing for the sacrifice
Of those who would dare

Fly, fly to the stars
Then let it fall
Into the emptiness of night
Our time has come
Time to move on
'Cause one day we have to say goodbye...

Here we go, carrying no longer sorrow
Standing up in the wind
Walk along, marching on for tomorrow
In this neverending way

Come with me to Paradise
Let's return again,
Let's return again!

To be closer to the skies
Living on a dream,
Living on a dream...

Standing up in the wind
Walk along, marching on for tomorrow

I'm not Mr. *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick

If you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet (10 feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you

Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of arguin' (of arguin)
I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be, it's just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content.
That song ""Guilty Conscience"" has gotten such rotten responses.""

And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinky

Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school

And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see an upper class city

Havin' this happenin' (this happenin' )
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name Is""

And pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
That copped me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)
To deal with these cocky caucasians

Who think, I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?

The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
Till I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (ahhh)
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (me crazy)
I can't take it, I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am

For something better
There's nothing better
Same old weird and familiar sound
It's just you leaving town, my God
August came around

Summer comes and
Leaves you with a fever
That you caught
When you were young
Summer goes, makes you feel
Like life is great
And hanging on for more

Empty streets, empty me
Just call me vagabond
Wondering in the sun
This is getting sort of old
Wandering aimlessly
Is it empty streets, or empty me?

Summer comes and
Leaves you with a fever
That you caught
When you were young
Summer goes, makes you feel
Like life is great

And hanging on for more

Hanging, hanging
Holding on for more, hoping, praying,
This will all start over
Come back for me
We will walk the streets
Of this old town
Make me a promise
This will all come back around

Summer comes and goes and leaves you
(You wanted more)
It comes and goes and leaves you

Summer comes and
Leaves you with a fever
That you caught
When you were young
Summer goes, makes you feel
Like life is great
And hanging on for more.

Hanging on for more."

Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out for you

I'm just so fuckin' depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump, but I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps, fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up in order for me to pick the mic back up

I don't know how or why or when, I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm startin' to feel distant again, so I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet

And I know some shit's so hard to swallow, but I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact, I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow, but you'd have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

I think I'm startin' to lose my sense of humor, everything's so tense and gloom I
Almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room, just as soon as I
Walk in, it's like all eyes on me and so I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that, then it opens the door for conversation, like I want that

I'm not lookin' for extra attention, I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room, maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant, tryin' to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack and half of 'em ain't even funny like ""Hah!

Marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, Goddamn!""
Unfortunately I am, I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down, listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

In my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see, what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

Nobody asked for life to deal us, with these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves and flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now I could have either just sat on my ass and pissed an' moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in and get up and get my own

I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
Or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in, in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid, even if it meant actin' stupid

Aunt Edna always told me, ""Keep makin' that face, it'll get stuck like that""
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there, holdin' my tongue tryin' to talk like this
Till I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then 'cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no more

But I already told you my whole life story, not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where your sittin' it's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each others' shoes at least
What size you wear, I wear 10's, let's see if you can fit your feet

In my shoes just to see what it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own. (Oh)
Everybody has their private world, where they can be alone. (So)
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through? (Oh)
Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out for you. (So)

Spoken
Yeah, to my babies, stay strong. Dad'll be home soon.
And to the rest of the world, God gave you them shoes, to fit you.
So put 'em on and wear 'em.
Be yourself, man. Be proud of who you are.
Even if it sounds corny, don't ever let no one tell you you ain't beautiful. (So)"

And now she won't even spare a passing glance,
All just because I ripped my pants

When Big Larry came 'round, just to put him down,
Spongebob turned into a clown
And no girl ever wants to dance
With a fool who went and ripped his pants

I know I shouldn't mope around and I shouldn't curse,
But the pain feels so much worse
But windin' up with no one is a lot less fun, than a burn from the sun,
Or sand in your buns!

Now I learned a lesson I won't soon forget,
Listen and you won't regret.
Be true to yourself, don't miss your chance,
And you won't end up like the fool who ripped his pants!"

Get on your hands and knees

We drank some Coca-Cola, we laughed a while and then
We dove into philosophy and politics and sin
The way we do
He told me he'd been looking the cold truth in the eyes
He told me my religion was wishing in disguise
He said ""The only Savior is the one inside your mind""
And I said ""if that's true
Then you can

Call me crazy 'cause I don't want to live that way
Call me lazy - I don't want to work that hard
Call me crazy, but I don't think that I can save myself

You see I've read a thousand pages on how to help myself
To a thousand different ways to perfect mental health
And I swear I've tried them all and I'm still needing something else
And I think you are too
So you can

Call me crazy 'cause I don't want to live that way
Call me lazy - I don't want to work that hard
Call me crazy, but I don't think that I can save myself

And furthermore I still believe in what I cannot see or touch
Crazy things like dreams and prayers and faith and hope and love
And I know a life without these things is not a life at all
So you can call it sanity but then you'll have to call me crazy

Through the window again
The fan blowing to hide the noise
No hesitation from the devil inside
Everyone he touched was destroyed

His madness only fueled the flame

And now the angels
Have lost their wings
In daddy's playground
Nothing is what it seems

This was the last time
That he'd see her
That he'd touch her
That he'd make his little girl
Scream out loud

I'm gonna pound you into oblivion
I will make you fucking bleed
There is no escaping me
This is your destiny

Time to walk with me
Time to walk with me
Time to die!

Let me take you somewhere secluded
Where only the trees can see
If I can't have you, no one will
Didn't you know it was always me?

Your flame now burned out
You were daddy's little girl
Your flame now burned out
Oh god, what have I done?

Oh god... what have I done?"

Hey, at ten 'o clock I don't wanna see
None of y'all little niggas up on the motherfucking block

Curfew nigga, get ta fuck up outta here off my block

Verse 1: Bizzy Bone

Who servin' tha fiends
Hundred thousands of green
For the love of money
Cash all around me
Demons can cloud me
While I'm in the county I can die
Flipped up my style-y as we came at the same time
Baby tempted, in the tension
Ouija shit got you demented
Crash the Benz and ending your sentence
Born for criminal defendants
Critical breaking in the ghetto bar thinking
Millennium shit like pestilence war and famine
Animals move animals reputed
Every daily grades let it be the reason
My Cleveland niggas revolve like dead bodies
In Eden leading seeping
And I don't wanna rock the pump
But I doubt it if I have ta pop the trunk
I'ma get 'em when they thinking they miss me what
Nigga that thuggish ruggish fuck them up
Rolling wid my bucks in the biggest snatch shit
All of my dogs all of we lie
Nigga you touched and stuck on murda
Smoking up bud and fucking up blunts
It was the 7th sign regime
Wid the nines and beams the philly and green
Wid a clik tight team and a nigga like me
Ya couldn't go wrong wid we
Eyes bloodshot red when I floss instead
I rather run up and smash you wid a passion
And they chalking it off his head
Nigga instead I'ma let them bleed
Nigga, immortal warrior from the walking dead

It's just another day I gotta get paid
Who got the biggest boulder
Who servin' tha fiends

Nigga act up and I betta take care ah ya
Scared ah ya, I be ready for the war
Nigga I'm America's Most
Barely coast ta coast
If you ready for whateva you can ride wit me
But if you lie ta me and don't die for me
Look in my eyes and see you can't hide from me
Sleepwalk shit talk nigga
That be running from niggas in the ghetto
Now get on my level rebuking the Devil
Representing like ah heavenly rebel
Even though my screws loose I can tigheten 'em up
And put a twist to the game like a monkey wrench
For the funny shit
All about the murda for the love ah money shit
Gettin' paid, got it made in the shade nigga
If you got and I want it I'ma take it
Nigga made it and I told ya we'd make it
Kept it real and it'd neva be fake shit
Half baked and gone off this indoe stick
Wanna hit it call just as you next
Hit it two times and pass
And nigga hold ya breath
Lay playing wid a half deck
Playin' wid ah half deck

Verse 3: Flesh N Bone

I'm fucked up but I bail on the darkside

Plannig ta sell the yayo for my mayo
Nobody be fucking wid Bone top platinum

Tell me what in the fuck you gon' do wid it
Stay drop and hit up they head

But she's more beautiful without it on

She's got a grace that I don't understand
She can move mountains with those tender hands
She makes a king out of a common man

There sits a monkey in a tall silk hat

To go?

Exactly what they say is real
So you push this back in your mind

Gotta hev it, I must know it
Here is my only chance

Sometimes a bottle of perfume
Flowers and maybe some lace
Men brought louise 10 cent trinkets
The intentions were easily traced
And everybody knew at times she cried
But women like louise well they get by

Everybody thought it kinda sad
When they found louise in her room
They'd all put her down below their kind
Still some cried when she died this afternoon

Too bad it ended so ugly
Too bad she had to go this way

And then I hit the switch that take away the top
So chicks around the way they call me cream of the crop

They hop in the car, I tell them, ""All aboard!""
We hit the studio they say they like the way I record
I gave you black train and I did you wrong
So everytime I see 'em, man, they tell me that's they song

They say I'm the bomb, they love the way the charm
Hanging from the neck and compliments the arm 
Which compliments the ear, then comes the gear
So when I hit the room, the shorties stop and stare

Then niggas start to hate, tearrange their face
But little do they know I keep them things by waist-side
I reply: Nobody gotta die
Similar to Li'l Weezy 'cause I got that fire

Drank the blood of a young baby
Offered unto him.

They danced ecstatically,
The orgied frantically.
The demon had arisen
From the circle on the floor.
The chanting was much louder
And more piercing than before.

Out of the abyss they rise,
When day sinks into darkness.

Living in the village,
Would die one by one by
The curse of the cult.
The head of the family,
A witchhunter named Mead,
Had burned their leadser at the stake;
Soon he'd regret his deed.

Pain from Devil's we evoke!
Thirst and suffer till he'd choked.
The magic did take over
And the soul did feel the roar.
Incantations were much louder
And more piercing than before.

Born in the bowels of the hills
Evil ones, sources of ills.
Setters of unseen snares,
Death to all pity, all prayers.

Female they are not.
No wives have they known.

A nod to the waiter, always her flirty behavior

She pulls out a letter
From a bag under her sweater
And before she reads she straightens her blouse

A grace in a loveless time
There's no new cross, there's no new sign
Only the sun and the changing tide

And out of respect, well really must confess
I never lost your number
I never lost your address
And if we remain friends at best
Sometime later no, no not yet
We'll smile and remember it like this

One tear falls like a feather
And disappears on the bar room floor

You know the letter concluded

Do you know what it feels like
To be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed?

If birds flying south is a sign of changes
At least you can predict this every year
Love, you never know the minute it ends suddenly
I can't get it to speak
Maybe finding all the things it took to save us
I could fix the pain that bleeds inside of me
Look in your eyes to see something about me
I'm standing on the edge and I don't know what else to give

Do you know what it feels like
Loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away?
Do you know what it feels like
To be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed?

How can I love you, how can I love you
How can I love you, how can I love you
If you just don't talk to me, babe?

I flow through my act
This question, is she needed?
And decide all the man I can ever be
Looking at the last 3 years like I did
I could never see us ending like this
(Do you know?) Seeing your face no more on my pillow
Is a scene that's never ever happened to me
(Do you know?) But after this episode I don't see

Com o reco-reco na m√£o

Do largo da Lapa
Foli√£o de ra√ßa
Bebendo o quinto copo de cacha√ßa
Voltou √†s sete horas da manh√£, mas s√≥ na quarta feira
Cantando ""A jardineira"", ""A jardineira""
Me pediu ainda zonzo um copo d'√°gua com bicarbonato
O meu peda√ßo estava ruim de fato
Pois caiu na cama e n√£o tirou nem um sapato
Roncou uma semana, despertou mal humorado
Quis brigar comigo, que perigo, mas n√£o ligo
O meu peda√ßo me domina, me fascina
Ele √© o tal
Por isso n√£o levo a mal
Pegou a camisa, a camisa amarela
Botou fogo nela
Gosto dele assim
Passou a brincadeira e ele √© pra mim."

How does it feel like this
To be caught in a web of a heavy grip
Where your mind can't believe or try to admit
That the one that you love is a fool you don't realize
When will you finally wake up
And the love that you hold is a taste of bad luck
And all that you have is a bag full of lies
He's blinded you deep by the look in the pit of his eyes

And If I knew that this could be
A total catastrophe
I probably would have told you a little sooner so you wouldn't get hurt
If I could change this possibly
It would be how you want this to be

Cause it ain't over till it's all done

'Cause you're distracted by affection
Can't you see that it isn't true
Love you thought you had and knew
And I've been chosen to tell you
That you're stupid and you know you gotta do it LEAVE!

When you are deep in love
It is hard to see past all the dirt and the mud
You tell everyone that it's great and okay
When you know in your heart
That it hurts and it won't go away
Afraid to let go of the hand
That you held so tight when he said I'm your man
But his eyes seem to sway at the flick of a switch
And you are alone in the dark with a bruised broken heart

And If I knew that this could be
A total catastrophe
I probably would have told you a little sooner so you wouldn't get hurt
If I could change this possibly

You know that I do get it right
The truest friend you can't deny
You know that I don't tell a lie
I know that you love him
It's clear that you'll put up a fight
To keep the love still in your life
But I must speak
The truth be told
Even though I know you love him

Cause it ain't over till it's all done
Listen to my conversation
Yes I'm trying to get your attention
'Cause you're distracted by his affections
Can't you see it isn't true

Each night as I sleep
Into my heart you creep
I wake up feeling sorry I met you
Hoping soon that I'll forget you

When I look in the mirror
And comb my hair
I see your face
Just a-smiling there

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run to, baby
Nowhere to hide

I know you're
No good for me
But you've become
A part of me

How can I fight a lover
That's sugar sweet
When it's so deep, so deep
Deep inside of me

My love reaches so high
I can't get over it
It's so wide
I can't get around it, no

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
From you, baby
Just can't get away
No matter how I try

I know you're no good for me
But free of you I'll never be

Nowhere to run to, baby
Nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run to, baby
Nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run"

Take a look around and tell me what you see.
Cause here I stand like an open book
Is there something here you might have overlooked.

And it would be a shame if you leave
And find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be.

The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad.
And now you say that you've grown tired
And you want to be by yourself a while.

It would be a shame if you go
And find that freedom was a long time ago

I know you can't stand for chains to bind you
But they just keep on driving us apart.
And you could go where I would never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from you're heart.

So one more time for old times sake
Come and lay your head upon my chest.
Please don't throw this moment away.
We can forget the bad and take the best.

And if you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for old times sake.
And if you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for old times sake."

Borne on the back of a black water water wave
Drown the eastern seaboard and lap at the southern plains
All in all it's a hell of a day to ride the high horse down the straight and narrow
To deliverance
I can harness the cosmos in the palm of my hand
Bring the earth to a grinding halt by single silent command
Lay the mountains asunder, turn oceans to dry land
I've found the key that unlocks the shackles of gravity
Stones are floating overhead suspended in perfect symmetry
And the stones they sing to me... whisper soaring melodies
Accept this offering. For the past to be buried. Sustained by longing
Breathe your life into me and cure my disease
Open the window. The center of your chest
Take an axe to the glass. Find a friend and hide
I've built a home for my sweet across the brooding sea
Every cut that I made, I thought of your face
And every stone that was laid made your image cease to fade
But alas I am scorned. Hereby sentenced henceforth to wander
In empty castles
Body is a device to calculate
Soul is the earth trodden under our feet
Mind is the beauty begging to be raped
God is a child tugging on the shirt tails of fate
The snake is charming us
Our voices will ring from skyscrapers down the ley lines
And carry out to sea
Accept this offering"

Lying on my back, wheeled under blinding light
Shackled restraints resist my attempted fight
The scalpels hovers over me, the incision is made
Once again they're watching me, no new sensation, just frustration 

They said it was for science
But I'm the human guinea pig
The guinea pig
The guinea pig
The guinea pig
The guinea pig
The guinea pig

My sleep has been altered, I open my eyes
The nightmare continues, I see through their lies
The papers keep turning, the tests never ends
Once again they're watching me, no new sensation, just frustration

They said it was for science
But I feel like the human guinea pig

Time may have passed on, but I won't soon forget
The old sensation, pure frustration of a human guinea, guinea pig"

In them Harleys, or them cowboys wit the blue wranglers

Smoke the what for your stress

'Cause ain't no high unless the Holy Ghost ain't rolled up in it

And preach the WORD, to my patnas catchin cases

Or the twisted roads that got me here
I have been to the end of the earth

Alors je plonge mes yeux dans les rondeurs de ta poitrine
Respirant tes parfums

I listen to the one, use who I got to use
Don't ever try and get too close, 'cause I'm a burning fuse

I'm living by the laws of a gun and a knife
My soul cannot be tamed, I'm living just to die
I'm living by myself on the outskirts of life

Live from state to state, living day by day
The only paycheck that I know is what I steal today
I like my girls real young, but keep marriage out of mind
I lick 'em and forget 'em because my friends I have no time
Never settle down, living just to fry
But all the things I take in life are things that you can't buy
I sleep all through the day time and I creep all through the night

Don't try talking to me, I just don't have the time
You bore me with your useless life, but you never know about mine
Listen to me closely, do exactly what I say
Give me what I want from you or I'll take it anyway
Liquor, drugs, whores and greyhounds, guns and violence too
In my world I'm living by the laws of who knows who
I have no fear of nothing, each day I set to die
So I'm living by myself on the outskirts of life

If you feel the rolling thunder
An' your eyes see lightning strike,
Don't be afraid, just call on me
I'll bring you shelter from the night

When the wind is howling
I'll hold you near,
An' soothe your troubled mind
With a little bit of this,
An' a little bit of that
I'll make you leave all your worries behind

Don't try to hold on to what you got,
'Cause I got what you need
Don't try to hold on, for anyone,
Come on, give it to me

Youngblood, you're hot property, youngblood
Youngblood, you're hot property, youngblood
Youngblood...

When you're burning hot with fever
An' you shake down to your bones,
Don't get yourself into a cold sweat
'Cause it's just your bad blood throwing stones
The devil has got your number
An' he wants you hanging on a line,
But, before the night is over, baby
I'm gonna make you mine

Don't try to hold on to what you got,
'Cause I got what you need
Don't try to hold on, for anyone,
Come on, give it to me

Youngblood, you're hot property, youngblood
Youngblood, you're hot property, youngblood
I'm coming to get you

Don't try to hold on to what you got,
'Cause I got what you need
Don't try to hold on, for anyone,
Come on, give it to me

Youngblood, you're hot property, youngblood...

I'm gonna make you mine..."

Here's one thing I've got to say
I'll be no good without you baby
I'll be no good without you baby
I got money
And I got fame
But if you leave me they don't mean a thing
That's why I'm begging baby, please don't go
That's why I'm trying girl to let you know
That's why I'm trying babe to make you see
Just how much, how much you mean to me

Oh baby, baby please don't leave me
If you leave me baby I'll live in misery
And I'll be no good without you baby
I'll be no good without you baby

Take my loving
Take my fame
'Cause if you leave me they don't mean a thing
But I'll keep on begging baby please don't go
I'll love you harder than I did before

Too late, I'm coming undone, what looks so strong, so delicate
Wait, I'm starting to suffocate and soon I anticipate
I'm coming undone, what looks so strong, so delicate

Choke, choke again, I thought my demons were my friends
Pity me in the end, they're out to get me
Since I was young, I've tasted sorrow on my tongue
And this sweet sugar gun does not protect me

Sittiin' in the dim cafe
Listenin' while the jukebox plays
The songs I like to hear when I'm alone
Thinkin' of my wasted past
Wonderin' if someday at last
I'll win the sweetest love
I've ever known

Then all at once I saw him
On the arm with my best friend
Heartbreak can't be far away
'Cause heartaches just walked in

I watched her as she smiled at him
And though the tiny lights were dim
I could see the love light shining in her eyes
With aching heart and trembling hand
It wasn't hard to understand
Why she'd someday be his wife

And as the teardrops started
I thought of things that might have been
Heartbreak can't be far away
'Cause heartaches just walked in

--- Instrumental

And then my poor heart skipped a beat
She took the table next to me
She didn't even notice I was there
But she looked around and just by chance
Our eyes met in a casual glance
She smiled and it was more than I could bare

How could he know the way I feel
To him I'm just a friend
Heartbreak can't be far away
'Cause heartaches just walked in

I smiled and turned the other way
My tremblin' lips just couldn't say
The way I feel, I wanted to explain
And so I guess you'll never know
How just a feiend could love you so
And hopes that he is happy just the same

But here with just a friend
For me it is the end
Heartbreak can't be far away
'Cause heartaches just walked in"

Are now destroyed and misplaced with mischievous weeds for greed
The purpose, inseminate the bitches
Eliminate top rappers, throw their remains insides of ditches
Nigga political snitches, Abe me which is
The very reason I'm able to strike so vicious

Take these keys, that for years were not found
Allowing all Simeons to be freed that's locked down
It returns way back to the block
Only to cop more Smack, Rock from cops that act
Not in a manner for you to prosper

You can handle the ball during a full-court press
When the weak emotion of love fails to bring hope
Kneel to your master nigga, invoke the strongest emotion
Known to mankind HATE!

Can be taken out by the likes of you Apes, Kikes

Braces the fact that I'm prepared for vicious acts of war

We need to snatch up these niggas and fags, reissue slave tags
Regain job positions, remain in control of opposition
Placed here to be the scum of the earth, serving us hand and foot
I'll rape 'em and slave 'and trade 'em from birth
Never to overlook the main crook who disperse shook
Versions of the bible, Sabotaging shit since Christophers arrival
Hate!
Making them Indian pay for survival
Now life for Ricans and Coons is homicidal
We Neo-Nazis seek nothing but world domination
God's plan is for us to seek and destroy man's false creation
It's exerted in the good book of Revelations
Set up to destroy spades and Jews from hidden stations
So my offspring's can end all this confusion for good
No more smooching off of welfare for jiggaboos in the so-called hood
Sickle cells decreasing your death rate, you black bitch
But I like the way you suck my wood
Germ grenades now in the form of A.I.D.S. were made to wipe you out
But now them queers got that shit semi-reversed running about
I'm off to college with a knapsack of sacrilegious artifacts

Just following prophets to nonsense
Tossin' what's right to the dust

And I ain't no casualty
Got no surface with spotless morality

Curl up in a ball
If it feels like home

If you can't sleep then lay there

Until you feel pure

As a means to an end

This must be the end of you
But you know this will never stop
You can't hear anything anymore
Just the hammer in your chest

Walk on through the growing noise
Of your inescapable path
Walk willingly into the dark
Nothing can touch you now

Empty
Empty
Empty
Filling up with sick

Like water in your lungs
Sucking yellow fog around your head

Once you were a child
The world was darker then
Fear was in the hall
But you won't think about that now

Just some warmth and a home
And an end to the task
Your doors are standing wide open
But it's too late for you now

Something's pulling you to the floor
Like a longtime friend
Someone's banging your head on the wall
As a means to an end

Burning plastic wound around your hand

What a day this is
Lord, I am tired
Look at yourself
What a day this is
Sometimes I wonder if you really understand

And although it's not quite the time
Although we've just begun to leave
We will tarry not to say we were wrong
To leave behind the silent reproach
And when our eyes are searching out
And our hearts are beating strong
We'll have a reason not to grieve
With holly leaves and scanning skies
And if the colors fade into night
And the storms our heads enclose
And our souls are set against one another
If the seas receive us not
And the skies mock our lowliness
Then we shall still love one another
For we are two, together
For we are two, together

What a day this is

Yeah, yo Cain (what up nigga)
Why wouldn't these bitches love us nigga?
Why wouldn't these niggas hate us huh?
(Why wouldn't they Fab?)
Yeah, (Desert Storm), uh, yeah, uh

(Fabolous)
Why wouldn't I talk as greasy as cheese steak meat
In a strawberry Range, pie crust piping on the cheesecake seats
I'm known for hittin' women's soft spots
With Princess cut Canaries the size of lemon cough drops

(Paul Cain)
I'm right behind 'em in the Porsche drop
Linen soft top, sick chain with 20 point rocks
Take your bitch, why wouldn't I?
The whip got chrome shoes, cream leather seats with old wooden sides

(Fabolous)
Uh, yeah, what's really poppin', usually boys know
This ghetto superstar with the Bruce Lee-roy glow
Niggas has to hate the outcome (yeah)
Plus I'm in a throwback from the same year they assassinated Malcolm

(Paul Cain)
Make so much ends, I got to find faster ways to count 'em (yeah)
A minute on the block, how fast I make a thousand? (Cain)
That nigga you love to hate, still hug blocks and bubble weight
Off the love I can't

(Fabolous)
Baby girl, why wouldn't fellas stop ya?
After we come through the hood in helicopters (yeah)

(Paul Cain)
The dro I got in this wood, is hela-proper
We do the damn thing, who could they tell us not ta

(Chorus - Fabolous (Paul Cain))
Why wouldn't this joint make you want to dance?
Why wouldn't these jewels make you want to glance?
(Why wouldn't this whip make you want to ride?
And why wouldn't this thing be on my side?)
Why wouldn't this game have you on your knees?
Why wouldn't these 20's be on the V's?
(Why wouldn't this money make you want to hate?)
Why wouldn't I what?

(Paul Cain)
Why wouldn't I pull up to the spot, yellow is all (ok)
Dressed in yellow linen, covered in Canaries never a flaw (uh huh)
Why shouldn't I wear this much ice
The Princesses in my hair, are clear and cut, right?
Why wouldn't I talk this slick (why not?)
With a watch and bracelet this flooded, and a cross this sick?
So why wouldn't I get it homes (I mean)
To a nigga gettin' money like myself, a little brain that's minimal (yeah)
Might talk but I live it though, sick chain glitter roll
Never sleep and don't stop gettin' that

(Fabolous)
Uh, hold up Cain, uh, why wouldn't I have samples of raw (uh huh)
And academic sample the laws (uh huh)
Hypnotic samples the poor (woo)
The European sample is all (yeah)
Will on the right side do with the wings stamped on the door
It's the street family boss, I land by the shores
Get pampered by whores, eat scampy and claws
The kid's been trampeled before by a tramp with no flaws
That's up to they get cramps in they jaws
I keep kefs jammed in the four
Amp meter draw, end up in a wheelchair rammed by your dog

(Chorus: Fabolous (Paul Cain))
Why wouldn't this joint make you want to dance?
Why wouldn't these jewels make you want to glance?
(Why wouldn't this whip make you want to ride?
And why wouldn't this thing be on my side?)
Why wouldn't this game have you on your knees?
Why wouldn't these 20's be on the V's?
(Why wouldn't this money make you want to hate?)
Why wouldn't I huh? Why wouldn't I what?

(Fabolous)
After a million scanned on it (yeah)
Why wouldn't the Range look like it got 20-inch ceiling fans on it (woo)
Only reason you in my face ma'am
Is 'cause I got the same mic/mike stat Jordan had on the ""Space Jam""

(Paul Cain)
Why wouldn't I chase chips
Come through Aves, like ""Pluto Nash"" in Coupes that look like spaceships
Ridiculous bracelet and the outrageous
Watch with flawless rocks, invisible placement

(Fabolous)
Uh, I oughta feel like a boss (uh huh)
Why wouldn't I get a 100 an appearance, quarter mil a endorse
I oughta feel some remorse
'Cause I'm killin' 'em out there, and a stick shift sport utility Porsche

(Paul Cain)
Yeah, I know when you see us, it be pissin' you off
Cause you would think we paid a fortune for the shit that we floss
Spend summers in my Sicily loft
Whole crib, interior decoration done by Christian Dior
(Baby girl), I got cops that's on the payroll
Jet skies, and speed boats docked up in Barbados

(Fabolous)
Green and cream Tims, brocolli and potatoes
Why wouldn't you see the Storm for the rocks and these tornadoes"

Paranoia builds this foundation of life
Forever till a change of times

They've killed the devil with undying affection
As he spoke with peaceful phrases before his dying breath
An unattained peace within his self before this death
For a handful of misbelievers of a no man's faith
When good made evil

Alarms triggering, in the back of your mind
Cracks streamline the walls of an empty skull
Prying into the sky

Behold, a circumstance untold of misconceptions
That lead to contradictions
Hi-fidelity of wrong proportions
That spiral into white noise

All obedience disruled... through a visual trap
Cast your stones... closet of skeletons
One to many broken bones

Hiding lies
A costly fear
Question all
Question its reason

An ecstasy you didn't reach... now empty for you

This glimpse of terror
A sight so unsound
An ecstasy you didn't reach

A blind mirror... no reflection... the real world

The furthest one has been
All this time is wasted
Standing on these actions
A quick jolt to reality

These mind terrorist invading a black sand beach
Extinguish a scene of this unleveled conflict
This lapse in time
Turn the page of life
This blame for pain
Been left behind

You acted like things never happen
A stab with simple little phrases
This action of serpent words
It's now your fear they're tasting"

There's big things 'bout to happen to you now, just release it

Then I creep like a lion, till the prey is mine
Can ya taste it?
They way I slip it and give it to you little by little
And minute by minute till it's mixed in your system like venomous liquid

DMX, Limp Bizkit, Sheryl Crow amongst many
Yo, just before I got on stage this chick came on to me
She offered me sumthin
It looked kinda strange, it was in a bag
I said ""Yo, girl let me talk to you real quick""
Yo

I don't sniff cocaine 'cause it mess up my brain
For sexual stimulation I never did no ecstasy
I don't pop pills, I never did no LSD
But I wouldn't mind a kiss from Ms. Mary
'Cause

She's homegrown and you can hold her in her backyard
She's homegrown and you can get a kiss in her backyard

I remember when I was a young boy
I waited for my grandad, ""So daddy can I get a puff?""
He looked at me, he says ""Son, man, you're too young kid""
""When you get older now and you understand that""
""I let you get one kiss from Ms. Mary""
'Cause

She's homegrown and you can grow her in her backyard
She's homegrown and you can hold her in her backyard
If she allows you to you can roll her up
She's homegrown and you can kiss her in her backyard
She's homegrown - I like to be with you Ms. Mary - in your backyard

That's when she looked at me and she said
""Wyclef this' what I want you to do son""

Come on
Inhale - exhale
Exhale - inhale
Inhale - exhale
Now hold it now
Inhale - exhale
Inhale - exhale
Exhale - inhale
Now breath in my face

Marijuan' Marijuan'

She said that
She's homegrown and you can grow her in her backyard
She's homegrown, she said ""'Clef, I'll kiss you in my backyard""
And my daddy don't need to know
She said that
I'm homegrown and you can grow me in your backyard
I'm homegrown and you don't need to worry for my backyard

That's when I said, ""I'ma get in trouble, I gotta go girl""
This' what she said
Laa la-laa laa laa, strictly la-la, to take me higher, and higher {2X}
Laa la-laa laa laa, strictly la-la, to take me higher

I'm about to take it higher {4X - in the background}

Suavemente acariciarte, y tocarte
Lentamente el cuello besarte
Provocarte, lograr excitarte
Como te gusta que en el cuello te hable
Suavecito, despacito
A ti te gusta como soy contigo

Blinded I run down these paths
By heart I know them
They lead to the soaring cliffs
Stout they stand above the water's edge
Lifeless

And this is my foundation
Cold stone
Formed only by winds and time
How invulnerable
Lifeless

Ah...
I have longed to be at one with this
Yet, the waters call my name

For once I wish to see
The entity behind the voice
The face of this seduction
The beauty of my pain

Am I blessed or am I cursed by thy presence?
What is my crime?
What is my deed?
Is this life my redemption?
Shall I repent or proceed?

I hate my flesh
Its dimension poisoned my soul with doubt
It made me question the essence of...
The 'I'

Slaves are those of this world
Given freedom to lay the chains upon The Master
The wolf is no longer free
Release the chains and come for me

Suddenly, his mournful cries were stunned.
Out of the cold mist came three enthralling ships.
Sails torn by many a storm, and the bows adorned by the
Most fierce gargoyles he'd ever laid eyes upon. Yet, the
Crew they bore... Three times twelve in numbers. They
Stood motionless, wrapped in grey, worn gowns.
And from behind their shadowed faces the seductive chanting.
Bidding him on board. without hesitation, he accepted.
And away they sailed...

Upon these seas
Wherein I drowned so many times
I scatter the ashes of destiny
Still my flame is in hunger

With fire in my heart
Shall I greet the shores ahead
Though, I know not what will burn...

Desire...

Ah...
In the distance
I hear the waves wash over solid ground
And in this moment I am struck blind

Grant me sight so I can see
That which lies ahead of me
Cursed be my mortal eyes
For dying in this realm of death

Hear my call...

I return to the soaring cliffs
They truly shine of strength
Even though I nothing learned
With strength I burn..."

He's got no time for you looking or breathing how he don't want you to
So step out the queue, he makes examples of you
And there's naught you can say
Behind they go through to the bit where you pay
And you realize then that it's finally the time
To walk back past ten thousand eyes in the line

And you can swap jumpers and make another move
Instilled in your brain you've got something to prove
To all the smirking faces and the boys in black
Why can't they be pleasant? Why can't they have a laugh?
He's got his hand in your chest, he wants to give you a duff
Well, secretly I think they want you all to kick off
They want arms flying everywhere and bottles as well
It's just something to talk about, a story to tell you

Well, I'm so glad they turned us all away, we'll put it down to fate
I said a thousand million things that I could never say this morning
Got too deep but how deep is too deep?

Well, this town's a different town today
Said this town's a different town to what it was last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday
And that girl's a different girl today
Said that girl's a different girl to who you kissed last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday
Of course not

Well, I'm so glad they turned us all away we'll put it down to fate

Because I know I'm not paranoid

Resembles Aunt Jemima
With jeans and a dirty white hoodie
Seems like he wouldn't be a snake
Or wouldn't disguises come in all sizes and shapes
Notice the facade of the snakes
They all catch the vapes
Even though last year they was GQ
Took a little time before the D-E-L could see through
The mask all I had to do is ask the heather wall Akwame
And my man responded they would bomb a
Fraudulent foe with the strength of Hercules
The way ya on my dick must really hurt ya knees
You need to take heed and quit being such a groupie
Ever since I did a little show in Guadeloupee
I neva saw a groupie like you
But what is funny is ya wanted to be down with my crew
But D-E-L is not down with any clowns or jesters
So I would suggest that ya try to impress Uncle Fester
Dobalina because ya don't impress me
Dobalina the style of dress is not the key

But is it all you crave

Treaties fail to rage a sea of 100 wars

Only darkness and death, I drink of pure darkness

Raping its souls

Destroying all
Into the heart of the weeping angel, kiss the hand of Satan
Destroying the light

The beginning of the new breed
This freedom burns in the fires of the earth

Human heads are impaled on warrior swords

All skies begin to burn...
A world of utmost desire
Realm of endless pain, storms forever rain

Falling stars from these dying souls are...
Drifting into hell
Laughing at lost might

Frozen nights... unholy nights, souls are drifting into hell
Heaven will fall
Satan comes to rule the earth, darkened souls forever more
Murder fills the world

While his heart breaks.

I'm waiting to be taken back
To the place I saw you last
Now just a photograph

So many people there
We loved every good thing we shared
Because that was the time we cared
For no one else

Summerfish
Makes me feel like dancing with my first kiss
Rolling in the sandy shore, we double in
Down to sun fading to gray

I'll be the moonshine
Makes me feel I'll never leave the sunlight
And now that you're inside me I'm a straight line
Stars are dying in to the waves

I caught a plane
I need to see you there again
Feel you touching on my skin
Watch our world begin

So many people there
We loved every good thing we shared
Because that was the time we cared

Destruction burns.
Fear pumps through the famous.
Desolation is in the air.
This is our station.

The weak, the corrupt. It dies.
Before our eyes it dies.
As far as the eye can see: only destruction.

Is it hopeless?
What can be done?

Is it too late?
Are we too late to save ourselves?
We're living in, in a dead world.

Crying out for a change.
What can be done?

Each day, we slip further away.
On the edge of ruin.

It won't be long before we succumb.
Is it hopeless?
What can be done?

Is it too late?
Are we too late to save ourselves?
We're living in, in a dead world.

It's so cold, and with no joy, we must save Ourselves.

Now this is a fight, because there is little left to hold on to.
And to beg forgiveness, for when in blackness, now I can see.

It's not too late, oh, not too late to save ourselves.
It's not too late, oh, not too late to save ourselves."

But just the thought of her leaving me
Leaves me helpless and broken in two

My sweet contradiction knows well the chains that bind me
My cure and my addiction is her love and only her love
Can set me free

And no I don't understand what did I do to deserve to be her man
She's such an angel so why is she flying so low
So she can love someone like me

I felt the loving
The blessing came when I needed it the most

The stars do not shine here
Be content to light your own path
And burn what you have crossed
The bridges were frail
The people, pretended

Storm forth with the light of the inflamed
Reclaim and ignite the sky
Brightly to blind
Rip off the veneers enabling opportunists to thrive
Dam the rise of grime and rats

More sickening than a social circle that believes itself charmed
Are the writhing droves of blowhards and yes men
Clamoring to slither in
Stay sovereign on the outside

We are who finished last
The unaffected
Contrasting the wide and white
We are who finish last
Sound
Indignant
The iron to gleaming teeth
The salt on saccharin
We who finish last
Proudly in their darkness
Lit from within

Glad hands grabbing for brass rings
Painting their bricks gold
Keen sycophants filthy scheming
Furthering the feuds of their adored
They have picked their enemies impeccably
Very keen indeed

And so siege the scorned

We are naught but beds of thorns and dark horses
Unwelcome guests who will just not mind their place
A single musket ball to pierce and lodge inside
And lead the circle to crack

We cast no shadow
The stars do not shine here
No genuine light to be found
Only rays of cold, synthetic beams on a mock aristocracy
So the vain and insecure can feel revered and cared for
For a cheap, fleeting moment
Truly noble

Proudly in our darkness

Dagger of the devil
Waiting to kill

He rules these waters like a king
He'll cut your heart out slicker than a dagger
Not 'cause he's hungry 'cause he's mean

You can see the shark now
Glidin' through the water
Ugly as death.


Eats anything
But the pretty barracuda, don't touch no leavins
Takin' what he wants to
'Cause he's king
And you can't scare him or entice him
He won't move for the devil, till his own time
Then quicker than heartbeat
He'll turn you away girl just to
See you fall, and leave you dyin'

That dwell amongst the clouds.
Hidden from the land at the edge
Of the world.
Hidden from the people once so proud.

Meldoria, a people sick of greed.
Meldoria, punished for their deeds.

During the last generations
They've turned their gods their backs.
Now they live in darkness
As the sky has turned black.

Greed and megalomania
Carried them away in blindness.
Throwing all ideologies and morals away
For egoism and carelessness.

Let you be guided by history,
Learn from your mistake.
Don't forget the high one's majesty,
Do not let your great ego awake.

As the holy powers withdrew their support
Great plauge infested the land.
The earth shook and ruined the world,
Seawaves threw up and drowned the land.

Only a few survived the disasters,
Left to breed a new generation.
Stand strong against the greed,
Do not give in for the evil powers
Of evolution."

The songs we used to sing
The smiles
The flowers
Everything is gone

Yesterday, I found out about you
Even though I'm just looking at you
Feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said, ""yes""

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no
Baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But, do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said, ""yes""

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go

Oh, I can't resist
Before you go
Tell me this
Was it worth it
Was she worth this?
No, no, no, no, no

Oh, how could I forget holding her in my arms?

Did I neglect all that mattered?

Remember when, just to feel my touch
Was all you ever needed
Oh it used to be enough

Remember when love
Was a promise we would give our lives to keep
And no river ran as deep

But was I chasin' rainbows

In the desk where next to your chair's the handle to your door
Dismantle the door handle, put the parts into your desk drawer
Say some words then make a sign, now open up the drawer:
The drawer can't tell you more
Than to deal with the door

Now you object to objects actually meaning more
Than some pathetic, lame aesthetic stolling rone is famous for
Push the drawer closed, grab a firehose, point it at the door
Get it all wet, remember, forget what rock &amp; roll is for
The drawer can't tell you more
Than to deal with the door

Now you're fishing for a mission way beyond the door
First you dream, next you're scheming, searching through your drawer
For an oar for your trip bound for yet uncharted shores
Over-reaching, find me spieling, cataloging doors
The door's a symbol for
These objects in your drawer"

And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone

And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating, intoxicating
Complicated, got away by some mistake and now

 Quedamos desenraizados
 Armarnos ser√° nuevo
 De nuevo aqu√≠ parados

 Aire, humo, entramos a escena
 Cuento los pasos
 Damos la cuenta
 Suenan los palos, las cosas truenan
 Tactos en danza sensual
 Nos acarician las venas.

 Vuelo, viajo...

 La nula expresi√≥n
 De algo simple encerrado
 Guardado con llave
 Y secretos impensados
 Objetos cercanos, nubes viajeras
 Hablando sin voz, pensando en la letra
 Campos de vuelta, ciudad, metr√≥polis nueva
 P√©talos caen miro arriba
 Balcones poblados
 Buller, bares y whiskies entrelazados
 La punta del hilo, el ojal
 La inocencia atando los cabos,
 Mirando de afuera
 Sintiendo que nada es de m√°s
 Aunque duela."

Born of the ball and chain
Into a world sustained with sorrow
Real love
A real touch we speak in
Is it lies.
Or is what we're seeking
Real love

Behold and you'll find the 21st century
Detonate her will and her widowed speech
Buried in the backyard shadow
The rusty coffee tin
That held her mother's first kiss in a
Nameless dream
Fall down the stairs again
To feel alive against tomorrow
Real love
Or is it me you're after
Is it time
'Cause it's now or never
Real love
Real love forever
Is it love
Or just yours to treasure
Real love
Real love
Real love
We never listen
Real love will listen
And tell her of my fortune
Real love is riches
Scratch through the changes
Real love is nameless
So tired and hopeless
Real love is painless
Nobody mentions
We ever move to collect
The solar questions
Demon scorn should not relax
The laws of gravity

You'll see it all in your baby
You'll see it all in your baby

No moment
Will be more true
Than the moment
I look at you

It's in you
You see somebody is watching
Over you
And that is all I'm praying is that

Someday you will understand
In God's whole plan
And what he does to you
Oh but maybe
Someday you will breathe
And you'll finally see
You'll see it all in your baby
You'll see it all in your baby
You'll see it all in your baby
You'll see it all in your baby"

Only now she drinks in the valleys
Where every road has a name like Beechwood Avenue
Or so it seems
A Croydon girl could really hope to find a home
But with a thousand miles of real estate to choose from
You begin to see the value of your freedom...

The moon is bright in the haze above old Hollywood
And deer look down from the hills
And it's three o'clock in the morning
Pill in hand you can hear his golden surfer boys
Crying out, ""Mummy won't come out of the bathroom!""
And you'd hoped he'd say he's sorry if he hit you
But he's buried in the screenplay of his feature

Screen kiss, one screen kiss
Straight from a film I forget who was in
Screen kiss, one screen kiss
Blue filter lens in a pool of vaseline
But all the rushes look the same
Only there's a movie I wouldn't pay to see again
If it's the one with him in

You and I could be a mile above the earth tremors
Hold to me and we'll climb
You could sneak out while he's sleeping
Suicide in the hills above old Hollywood
Is never gonna change the world
Change the world overnight
Any more than the invention of the six-gun--child--
Any more than the discovery of radium,
Or California tipping in the ocean

Screen kiss, one screen kiss
Straight from a film I forget who was in

That his life would turn into darkness
And alone he would face all demons
From his past that he tries to forget
An elder king warned of the dangers
That lie in the valleys of north and
His only change was to find his shadow
So he had to set forth

He is the man who travels in the land
Of dragons and magic spells
He rides in the winds of fire and snow
And he rules the forest of elves

A flash in the burning night
Curse of the evil lord
He is fighting for his life for the last time

He is the man who travels in the land
Of dragons and magic spells
He rides in the winds of fire and snow
And he rules the forest of elves

Oh, such beauty in time
But it's just external
He cannot see the truth with his eyes
So he is bound by a lie

The snow starts falling in paradise
As he gazes at the stars
He will be born again in the sky
When the night turns into a dawn

The snow starts falling in paradise
As he gazes at the stars
He will be born again in the sky

He is fighting for his life for the last time

On the way to the ancient castle of time
He will soon be damned by rage
So that his pride could betray him
When it's time to set him free
The tears in his mind had to be pushed aside
As he walked through the gates
He will never die
'Cause he is truly a Hero in a Dream

He is the man who travels in the land

Thought maybe I'd died and went to Heaven
But I got to thinking and baby, I knew better
'Cause I know that angels don't, angels don't wear high-healed shoes
I don't need an angel
That don't fly around the blue
I'd be more than grateful
With a woman that was just like you

Sweet baby don't you change baby don't you change
Baby don't you change, baby don't you change a thing
No baby don't you change a thing
You don't need no angel wings
You look so good you make a grown man scream oh baby no, baby no
Don't you change a thing

First time I saw your face on a photograph
I thought maybe I was looking at the cover of a magazine
Oh oh oh


But I got talkin' to you and baby, I knew better
'Cause I know most models don't, models don't know how to hold a conversation
I don't need a model, you can let 'em
Flirt around the page or the stage
I'd be more than grateful
With a woman that had your face

Sweet baby don't you change baby don't you change
Baby don't you change, baby don't you change a thing

Delilah was a woman fine an' fair
Her pleasant looks-a, her coal black hair
Delilah gained old Samson's mind
A-first saw the woman that looked so fine

A-well went Timnathy, I can't tell
A daughter of Timnathy, a-pleased him well
A-Samson told his father, 'I'm goin' a-a-a'
(Help) me Lord

If I had-a, ah Lord, tear this building down

Samson's mother replied to him
'Can't you find a woman of your kind and kin?'
'Samson, will you please your mother's mind?'
Go'd and married that-a Philistine

Let me tell you what, old Samson

Well, he roared at the lion, the lion run
Samson was the first man the lion attach
He caught the lion and got upon his 'ack
A-written that he killed a man with his
And Sampson had his hand in the lion's jaws

If I had my way
If I had-a, a wicked world
If I had-a, ah Lord, tear this building down

'Well, your riddle please, a-tell it to me'
'A-how an eater became forth meat?'
'Well, your riddle please, a-tell it to me'
'A-how strong of it came forth sweet?
Deliah, got his army after him
Well, the bees made-a honey in the lion hair

Well, if I had my way
Well, if I had-a, a wicked world
If I had-a, ah Lord, tear this building down

Sewed me tow knot, an' formed a plot
Not many days 'fore Samson was caught
A-bind this hands whilst a-walkin' along
A-looked on the ground and found a lil' jawbone
He moved his arm ropes, a-pop like thread
Dropped those threads free, three thousand were dead

Lord, If I had my way
Well, if I had a, a wicked world
If I had a, ah Lord, tear this building down

Weh-ell
Samson's trick though they never found out
Till they began to wonder about
A-till his wife sat up upon his knee
'A-tell me where your strength lie, if you please?'

Samson's wife she a-talked so fair
Told his wife cut off-a his hair
'Shave my head, clean as your hand
Till I become a natural man!'

Well, if I had a, a wicked world

We will set fire to your machines. 
We will put life back into hearts and you will suffer. 
We will run life through our veins and you will suffer. 
Passion will be found in time, and your world will fall behind us.

And a voice soft and low said:
""Listen here friend, your girl's going out
With some other guy, and I think you should
Know your girl is untrue
Know there's somebody new
And the love of your life
She's making a fool of you""

I hung up the phone and I went to my room and I cried
Cried all through the night
I said to myself, if I lost your love
My life would just end, so I'm begging you
Please, please say it's a lie
From some envious guy
And the only thing true
Is you love me like I love you!

Anything

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel

Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads

I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes; they're all I can see

I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all

If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?"

When morning comes
She hides away

To tell you what's really here in my heart
There's only so much that words can say
So I send you a piece of this beautiful day

Oh, I want you to know that I took a rainbow
And sent it off in a letter to you
Took some flowers in the spring, made a sweet clover ring
And sent it off in a letter to you
Took a song from the lark - the moon frm the dark
A spark from the sparklin' dew
With a kiss and a hug and a whole lot of love
I sent 'em off in a letter to you

I took the mornin' sun peekin' through the trees
And the dandelion silk tangled in the breeze
I folded 'em up - sealed 'em with a kiss
It's the kind of letter that you can't resist

Oh, I want you to know that I took a rainbow
And sent it off in a letter to you
Took some flowers in the spring, made a sweet clover ring
And sent it off in a letter to you
Took a song from the lark - the moon frm the dark
A spark from the sparklin' dew
With a kiss and a hug and a whole lot of love
I sent 'em off in a letter to you

In a day or two - just you wait and see
You're gonna get a special delivery
You'll know the way I feel - there can't be any doubt
When you open it up and let the love spill out"

From pieces of a broken mirror, sliced my wrists, bled

Shit, my wicked rhymes will have you overdose

I spent a lot of time, perusin' the T Dot
Maybe a beats hot, but syllables bleeped out
Many men turn to mice when searchin' for cheese, auk
Pick up these guitars, not negative heat knocks now

I'm like a rangular, angular, rhyme strangler

Of DJ X and mastermindin' the underground

Hip-hop head forever, tryin' to keep it together

Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
Pressure brain, pressure flowin' on my head like rain
But fame can bring pain
That's why I got game and a rude attitude
That I call Emily M

So you can get the Prozac if you claim to know
That what I'm livin', I break it down like long division
A mathematician with inner vision like Stevie
No wonder, I make a move from one street to Vancouver
Lookin' for philosopher's stone

There's a light we can love on the way
There is a wonder and wildness to life
And freedom for those who obey

And all those who seek it shall find it
A pardon for all who believe
Hope for the hopeless and sight for the blind

To all who've been born in the Spirit
And who share incarnation with Him
Who belong to eternity stranded in time
And weary of struggling with sin

Forget not the hope that's before you
And never stop counting the cost
Remember the hopelessness when you were lost

There is a joy in the journey
There's a light we can love on the way
There is a wonder and wildness to life
And freedom for those who obey

And freedom for those who obey..."

Invites ton amant dimanche √† d√Æner

De foot, de po√©sies, ou bien de son m√©tier
Ou peut-√™tre de toi, Dolorosa
Peut-√™tre de toi, Dolorosa

J'ouvrirai un grand vin, tu ouvriras ton corsage
Mon regard se perdra au loin presque g√©n√©
Il te demandera, de rester un peu sage
Au creux de ton oreille, et tout, il te promettra
Comme j'avais tout promis

Je le trouverai trop beau, je te trouverai tr√®s belle
Ton visage aura perdu tant d'ann√©es

Vos yeux s'embrasseront

Et puis nous auront bu
Oui nous auront trop bu
Au milieu de vos souffles
Je n'existerait plus
Sur la pointe des pieds
Je quitterai la table
Et je m'√©loignerais
Des fous rires entendus

To be a burning legacy of love to Him

Strike the match and heat up your heart
Start the fire
Let it burn until we make a mark
Start the fire
Let it turn into a raging flame
You'll see, you'll never be the same
Once you start the fire

And you and I are bonded by

Start by looking at Him
And bring Him all our energy

Waiting to move
We are here

End, they just won't end

Cause you can't put out an old flame
By pouring whiskey on the fire

And tonight he'll make a toast to her memory
And then he'll take another shot of a 100 proof of misery
And his old broken heart still burns with desire
Cause you can't put out an old flame
By pouring whiskey on the fire

His tears fall like rain but his pain just wont die down
Cause there's another blaze that's brewin
As he buys another round

I could see that girl was no good to me
And just like a slave I was lost and no man could free

At break of day when this man drove away, I was waiting
I crossed the street to her house, she opened the door
She stood there, laughing
And I felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more

I been missin a screw like Bishop and Juice
I could lose it at any moment
Those who know me know it
So they probaly told you go with the flow
Just so that I don't explode
And have another episode where I let it go as far as
The one with Benzino did

I'm waitin for that next beef
I'm cocked, locked and loaded
I'm ready to go so bad I'm goin bananas
My dick's so hard Anna Nicole could use it
To fuckin' pole vault with
Oh shit, I mean when she was still bloated 
Before they cut her stomach open and lipoed it

Anybody I throw flames at gets a name it's a game
Cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame, what people do for 10 minutes of fame
Everyday it's the same thing
People in this game try to buddy buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us
Everybody just wants to have somethin to do with that
They all tryin' to get that stamp
They after that Shady/Aftermath money

It's like a monopoly
They probaly just now finally understand how to rob fully
50 Cent was like a fuckin' jackpot for me 
And Dre, it's like we hit the fuckin lottery

And a damn slot machine at the same time as each other
Why the fuck you think we rhyme like we brothers
When we rhyme with each other 
In time we discovered that we had more in common 
Then we thought with each other

Both robbed of our mothers
Our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault
Cause we started thinkin God doesn't love us
Two hard motheruckers who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica Queens
I still remember the call up in chunking cause

Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives he's gettin dropped from Columbia
Two years later me and Doc had to come and operate
That's when he popped up a number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wonderin
Even if I'm under the gun 

You ain't gotta agree all the time with me
Or see eye to eye there'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is if it is I could give a shit 
Still gonna conduct motherfuckin buisness as usual

Ego's aside, fore I bruise em' all 
Swallow your pride fore I step on it with shoes you call Nike's
Earth links how do you like these you gotta love them
Look at the bottom of em' they're like cleats
Stompin, I been rompin since Tim Dogg was hollerin
'Fuck Compton'

I was whilin', freestylin'
Back when they was still makin Maxell cassettes
I wasn't even raps Elvis yet 
That tells us that any doubts in your head that seals the shit

He said, ""Ask anything""

Were spent by the telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came

Surrounded, surrounded

Everyone ends up alone
Losing her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am
Who I'm not, and who I wanna be

How long she will be next to me

And I've been calling
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never sent me no letters

Taking all I want

New structure eating up the old
The process we all have this nameless dread about

Cold shoals
Their bloodless arms enfold
The earthen engines moan
Corruption, the feast out in the cold
Everybody leaves this dance alone

Lashed up, clinging to a thing
The nights are drawing in, that there's no doubt about
Wild rapture: the old familiar code
This brute reflex is nothing much to shout about

Pegged out, pulling down the stone
Botched, brave and alone
Fierce lustre blistering the soul
Mourning for those I will never know

Stake out, cops inside a van
To test a theory that the world is credible
My brains boiling in a pan
Tests have shown they prove to be inedible

Own up
The terrifying trees
Will shake the leaves around
Dumbstruck
Starts at every sound

The whole world sharin' one big kiss
These are thoughts all through my brain
That I daydream every day
I'm alive and well
Right now I'm alive, I'm feelin' well
It's my life to live my way
So I'll keep daydreaming away
Who knows, maybe someday it will all come true
And I will get my way
And we will live as one

I'm caught up in a dream
I'm gonna wish for it all
No one is gonna tell me how
No way, this is my dream now
I'm caught up in what seems
Simply impossible
I ain't gonna change a thing
No way, it's my dream

What cannot will be done
For every living thing under the sun
Foggy color foggy race
Just be one big happy face
Among the sea of people
Live among God's creatures sharing love
That was sent down from above
Here to share with one another
Father, brother, sister, mother
Everybody sharing love
Sharing love

I'm caught up in a dream
I'm gonna wish for it all
No one is gonna tell me how
No way, this is my dream now
I'm caught up in what seems
Simply impossible
I ain't gonna change a thing
No way, it's my dream

I close my eyes
And everything will be all right
Here in my fantasy
Living in harmony
Make my dream come alive

I'm caught up in a dream
I'm gonna wish for it all
No one is gonna tell me how
No way, this is my dream now
I'm caught up in what seems
Simply impossible
I ain't gonna change a thing
No way, it's my dream

The whole world sharin' one big kiss
Take away the pain and hurt
Make like heaven here on earth
Without reason to die
Givin' everlasting life to all"

Would you be easy to find
Would I be looking all night?
And if I got lost
Would you go looking for me?
Or would you be all right
On your own?

Oh, in the light of day
It feels right
Comfortable to the bone
From head to toe
Come the evening when the shadows fall
Well I call your name
But it's not the same as having you here

If I was a second too late
Or a moment too soon
Or an hour too long
Tell me baby would you wait a bit longer?
I wonder if you would
Or would you be long gone?
Would you be alone, would you be alone

Oh, in the light of day
It feels right
Comfortable to the bone
From head to toe
Come the evening when the shadows fall
Well I call your name
But it's not the same as having you here

As having you here
As knowing you're near
As a feeling you left
As knowing you care
As whispering in your ear
As my hands in your hair
As knowing you're there

Oh, in the light of day
It feels right
Comfortable to the bone

Come the evening when the shadows fall
Well I call your name

Was paralyzed by fear
When they heard a mighty multitude
Was quickly drawing near
But as they prayed for deliverance
The victory would begin
For when we call upon the Lord
We summon all of Heaven

Pray on
For you are who the Lord is looking for
Pray on
For this will tear those mighty strongholds down
Stay on your knees
For this is where the battle is won
Very soon you'll win the victory
Pray on

When Daniel faced the lions
For worshipping the Lord
It seemed there was no hope at all
For what would be in store
But when we stand on holy ground
Our smallest prayer is heard
Instead of on our circumstance
Our eyes are on the Lord

Pray on
For you are who the Lord is looking for
Pray on
For this will tear those mighty strongholds down
Stay on your knees
For this is where the battle is won
Very soon you'll win the victory
Pray on

When your questions go unanswered
And your prayers may seem in vain
They don't seem to make a difference
They don't seem to make a change
Just rest assured God knows your needs
And He hears each time you pray
Your prayers are reaching Heaven
And the answer's on the way

Pray on
For you are who the Lord is looking for
Pray on
Tear the mighty strongholds down
Stay on your knees
For this is where the battle is won
There's no better place for you to be
Then seeking the Father prayerfully
Very soon you'll win the victory
Pray on

Some people want nothin' out of life
And some people want it all
Some people ain't livin' life right
But fast money make God call
I'm prayin' to the angels, but worship the devils
Yeah a nigga rich but I'm livin' like a rebel
Ridin' with my strap on, foot on the pedal
Them silly beef raps, now they on another level, level
I grew up on a crop side, the New York Southside
Stayin alive was no jive
Standin on the strip you get stuck like velcro
Jake jump out, you see heads and elbows
Run nigga, run nigga, here they come nigga
Throw that pack nigga, toss that trigger
Kid I'm still in the P's, girl I love the Audi
If yo' ass pregnant girl, leave the party
My stashbox so big, it could move the shotty
God it ain't my fault, if I shoot somebody
I ain't in it to lose, I'm in it to win
Sex, money, murder, take the safety off my sins (yeah!)

Buckle down, do anything for the dollar
Enough bills'll make your blood spill
Kill for bread, anyone will from Queens to Gun Hill

Shiny trey-pound, black 9-mil
Magucci leather got me shoe crazy
Quarter mil' vehicle and I'm a oops baby
And if I'm wearin my chain it's 380
Like Fat Joe, nigga you crazy?
Man fuck friends, this T-dot-O-dot-S
Have it how you want, speed knot or pop chess

It feeds my kids, it fills my fridge
It pays my bills and the mortgage on the crib
It keeps me icy, it make hoes like me
It gives me, seats at the Garden next to Spike Lee
It made me rich, it made me change
I seen a lot of places and bought a lot of things
You got me haters, you got me drama
You paid for the lawyers, you paid for the llamas
You make niggaz goners, you rule all the corners

Now where they are I wish I knew

They roll by just like water
And I guess we never learn
Go through life parched and empty
Standing knee deep in a river and dying of thirst

Sometimes I remember sweethearts I've known
Some I've forgotten I suppose
One or two still linger, oh, and I wonder now
Why I ever let them go?

They roll by just like water
And I guess we never learn
Go through life parched and empty
Standing knee deep in a river and dying of thirst

So the sidewalk is crowded, the city goes by
And I rush through another day
And a world full of strangers turn their eyes to me
But I just look the other way

They roll by just like water
And I guess we never learn
Go through life parched and empty
Standing knee deep in a river and dying of thirst

Or just simply turn away
Set a course for the desert sun

This is the only choice we'll know

Cut your teeth and now it's time to show the world that what your made of
Was a travesty that many just call luck

Now climb aboard the red line train that's headed out of town
Or stick around and just relive your past

You said ""Have some toast instead""
I was sleeping maybe three hours
You said ""You should get to bed""
I was waiting at the church door
For the minister to show
I was looking at the new year
You said ""Walk before you crawl""

I was feeling like a loser
You said ""Hey, you've still got me"" 
I was feeling pretty lonely 
You said ""You wanted to be free""
I was looking for a good time
You said ""Let the good times start""
With a quiver of your eyelid
You took on someone else's part

But what about me
I don't really see
How things will improve
If all you want is to stay...

Maybe I'm a little greedy
You said ""Think before you speak""
Sometimes I'm a little seedy
You said ""Everyone is weak""
Now I feel a little better
Is there something I can do?
But I never heard the answer
I never had a clue

But what about me
I don't really see
How things will improve
If all you want is to stay
The lights are on in the house tonight
Going to creep around going to creep into your head

There's a little echo calling
Like a miner trapped inside
If I tell her of this moment
She will in me doubts confide
And she's on me like a blanket
Like a stalk of wilting grass
I'm not sure about her motives
I'm not sure about her past

But my faith is like a bullet
My belief is like a bolt
The only thing that lets me sleep at night
A little carriage of the soul
If it starts a little bleaker
Then the year may yet be gold
Happiness is not for keeping
Happiness is not my goal

But what about me
I don't really see
How things will improve
All you want is to stay loose

Oh what about them 
You play mother hen
To a gaggle of gangling youth
All you want is to stay 
The lights are on in the house tonight
Going to creep around going to creep into your head

I was living through the seconds
My composure was a mess
I was miles from tenderness
It was dark outside, the day it was lying in pieces
Everything is flat and dreary
I couldn't care what's in the news
Television is the blues
Television is hysterical laughter of people

I don't know, it could be me
I'm always asking for more
I keep running 'round in circles
I keep looking for a doorway
I'm going to need two lives
To follow the paths I've been taking"

Would heal a nation's bleeding heart

He said that the balance of the deficity
Would set us free

Cause the Dow had never sunk this far
So he searched for the deliverance
At the bottom of a bottle at a local bar

Everybody, Everybody wants to be free
But I'm here to tell you

Freedom
Can only be found in the blood of Jesus
Freedom
Can only be known in the love of God
Freedom
Comes to whoever would dare to believe Jesus is
Freedom

A child once spoke of the hour
When school would end and he could play
His freedom waited for him

For a stickball challenge on the avenue
If he could get past the dealer

We're screaming towing the line
And disposable by design.

So get lovely lovely lovely my girl
I don't wanna be the one to tell you
The luckiest luckiest luckiest world
Is the on between your eyes
Imagine-magine if we we were thin
In the crown of the conqueror worm
And as time pens down we'll say that we'll always feel this way.

Shock to the heart and away we go
And if you wake up in the morning and it still feels wrong
Then put your money in the sad machines
For bombs, punks and tiger teams

Wear heavy metal pants for the labelin' head
Who can blame it on the band who killed themselves next door
For just another little chance to love a lie
I say they loved a lie.
And we will kick them straight down the line
With a conscience clear of mind.

So get lovely lovely lovely my girl
I don't wanna be the one to tell you
The luckiest luckiest luckiest world
Is the on between your eyes
Imagine-magine if we we were thin
In the torch of the Conqueror Worm
And as time pens down we'll say that we'll always feel this way.
Hey... hey...

Chorus repeat...
In the mouth of the Conqueror Worm
And as time pens down we'll say that we'll always feel this way.

Hold on The Conqueror Worm
And screw your courage to the hardest part
They're only looking for an open chance to break your heart"

About our faith and love
I see it in your faces thin as shadow
See me as I figure in your late night plan
See me as I'm cocooned up in Badland
The side effects of cruising at the speed of life
The side effects of living in temptation
When only one star is waiting up on all of us
You'll see me as I'm cocooned up in Badlands
And how do I feel living in the eighties
And will I ever get to see the light of day

Kyoto in the snow but Heaven's far away
Sending their love - passion parade
Hunter and the Hunted
With me first times can never lie

They were young - they were brave - they were the honest set
The greatest show on earth is here tonight love
See me as a figure in the late night plan
See me as I'm cocooned up in Badlands
The side effects of cruising at the speed of life
The side effects of living in temptation
When only one star is waiting up on all of us
You'll see me as I'm cocooned up in Badlands
And how do I feel living in the eighties
And will I ever get to see the light of day

Kyoto in the snow
Heaven's far away
Sending their love
Passion parade

With me first times can never lie
Only with you
Life moves so fast

When your hear me screaming
I'll be seeing through the eyes of love

Tell me can you hear me
Tell me can you see me

I wish I was
'Cause then I'd know I was down because
I couldn't find a friend around
To love me like they do right now
They do right now

I'm dizzy from the shopping mall
I searched for joy but I bought it all
It doesn't help the hunger pain
And a thirst I'd have to drown first to ever satiate

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
At all

When autumn comes
It doesn't ask
It just walks in where it left you last
You never know when it starts
Until there's fog inside the glass around your summer heart

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
At all

I can't be sure that this state of mine
Is not of my own design
I wish there was an over-the-counter test
For loneliness like this

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is
Something's different
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is

Who's crazy about all the latest dances
Black bottom stomps and the Jew baby prances

The other night at a swell affair
Soon as the boys found out that I was there
They said, ""Come on, Ma let's go to the cabaret""
Where that band you ought to hear me say""

I want to see that dance you call the black bottom
I wanna learn that dance
Don't you see the dance you call your big black bottom
That'll put you in a tranc&amp;101

They say your black bottom is really good
Come on and show me your black bottom
I want to learn that dance

I want to see the dance you call the black bottom

Come on and show that dance you call your big black bottom
It puts you in a trance

Early last morning 'bout the break of day
Grandpa told my grandma, I heard him say
Get up and show your old man your black bottom
I want to learn that dance

Now I'm gonna show y'all my black bottom
They stay to see that dance
Wait until you see me do my big black bottom
I'll put you in a trance

Ah, do it ma, do it, honey

Two bad boys got up to fight.
One old man yelled, ""Hey, keep quiet!""
The next thing you know they started a riot.
While everybody was-a jumpin' around
All you could hear was that Bullmoose sound.

Everybody asked him, ""Won't you sit down and play?""
When all of a sudden the room began to shake
""Whoops!"" he cried, ""It's a real earthquake.""

Surely there's someone for me

His woman threw him out in the ice and the snow
And she told him, ""Never ever come back no more""

So he walked through the rain, and he walked through the mud

He said, ""Mister Motherfucker, you know who I am?""

And I kick motherfucking asses like you every day

Known to make more money than any bitch in town

She struts across the bar, hitching up her skirt
Over to Stagger Lee, she's starting to flirt
Oh, Stagger Lee...

She saw the barkeep, said, ""Oh God, he can't be dead!""

""But there's something that I have to say before you begin

Here comes the rain again, falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again, becoming who we are
As my memory rests, but never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Wake me up when September ends
Ring out the bells again, like we did when spring began
Wake me up when September ends

Drenched in my pain again, becoming who we are

'Cause I'm tired of San Francisco
My contracts are finally void
And I am getting out
On houses and building tops
I swallow the beams and sun drops
If my echos could reach your ears
Then I could save my calls
What happens when I'm above
The east river when you are in love?
We're staring at all these lights
And I am going blind

Fill all of the Navy yards
With hard working security guards
'Cause the numbers are wearing off
My plastic access cards
How can I begin to say
I feel better off when we stayed
In Paris on winter nights
Beneath a snowy veil?
Content like a panda bear
Still breathing the fresh mountain air
I'll put on a diving tank
And sing when I inhale"

porque nunca consultaste al diccionario 
de acero inoxidable eran tus tripas 
para bancarte a un pais tan sanguinario. 
Con una mano encima de la otra, 
y el surco de la guerra en los bolsillos, 
estabas en la foto de familia 
desafiando el aire de los conventillos. 
Ni bueno, ni malo, ni sue√±o prestado 
lejos del lirismo afila el cuchillo 
para cortar en dos la luna llena 
y alimentar al mundo de posguerra.
Y una noche de julio en medio del campo 
al borde de un camino empantanado 
se aparecio el demonio y lo corriste 
con la estampita de San Cayetano. 
Fundaste un sindicato clandestino 
hecho de sudor y de destierro 
Per√≥n los hizo suyos y argentinos 
con una mano dulce como el hierro. 

Ni bueno, ni malo, amor siciliano 
dolce farniente, vendeta caliente 
buscando el sue√±o de la juventud 
te convertiste en un fantasma, a plena luz."

Except now you've strayed too far
Need you to stop digging your hole
And follow the path we light

Don't need an invitation to be reconciled
Cause these home fires are burning
I stare into your empty eyes and wonder...

How could something so right turn out so wrong?
You spent your time making excuses
For the ways of life that you are choosing

How could something so right turn out so wrong?
Not sure exactly where I am

The more we organize we suck out this life
That serves as the fuel behind
You wanna take the passion in my veins
And put it down in black &amp; white

You've got your foot directly on the gas
I watch you burn out so fast
Now I can see just what you've become

And how could something so right turn out so wrong?
I don't have a backup plan
This is all that I am

Children starve by the millions
The false of the lame
Of the foolish few who knew them
Then led them to the shame

The king he knights the players
They all know the score
But nobody told his mistress
She was pushing forty-four

I don't want to know
Where we're heading for
We don't have long to go
We'll hear footsteps in the dawn
'Cause it's just some sort of
Crazy ride we're on


The queen she knows the exit
She's been there once or twice
Whe her saviour got ostricized
For selling free advice

And her knight in shining armour
Comes sliding through the door
Sporting suggestive glances
At all the dancers on the floor

Well I dreamt all those lonely people
I knew them by their names
But their faces lost their identity
In the fury of the flames

They talked in foreign riddles
Lik actors on a stage
But when the word came they were standing scared
Lost in a doomed age"

Didn? have a care in the world, got by day by day
Struggled with the plans we'de made who was I anyway

Workin?on both night and day, in a famous rock and roll cafe
Never thought I'd meet a girl for me
Never thought I'd meet a girl called Cerilene

Cerilene, the road of life is dark without you and I, I just can't see
Cerilene, share my life with me
We'll go together hand in hand and we'll fulfill our dreams

Walked along the beach there hand in hand, it felt like a dream
But things that felt so good were never real or so it seemed
The magic that this girl possessed
Changed the heart of a child to a man (to a man)
Through the warmth of love his dreams and drive had direction again

A girl who strongly believes in me, and visions that we both could see
As one of my dreams, it came to an end
My life and love felt whole again

I've grown to love this family, my friends
And this woman that I've found
Just as much as the family I left in a small, small Southern town
On a day the island breezes brought my loved ones here with me
We made our families one, I love you, oh I love you Cerilene

Cerilene, the road of life is dark without you and I, I just can't see
Cerilene, share my life with me
We'll go together hand in hand and we?l fulfill our dreams

Still agreed to disagree
You're connected to the heart
But tonight we'll set you free

So swallow the knife
Carve the way for your pride
Now our hands are tied
The problems lie within
So we pray for night
To start over again

Even now as I write this down
All pretensions disappear
Now our impulses will bite
At the ankles of our fear

So swallow the knife
Carve the way for your pride
Now our hands are tied
The problems lie within
So we pray for night
To start over again

Now our hands are tied
The problems lie within
So we pray for night
To start over again

Words are spoken
Words are broken down

So let's make this night
Be our best mistake
So let's take the time
To wipe the blood away

Now our hands are tied
And the world is caving in

Now our hands are tied
The problems lie within
So we pray for night

You dropped the hammer of love

Tequila through Lucy's sequins.

The boom box sings ""Dandelion"".

You dropped the hammer of love
On me.
Babe, you dropped the hammer of love,
Don't drop the hammer of love
On me.

Now you're in the stars
Up in the autumn lights -
A stage set the befits
A Chieftain of our tribe.
Don't forget me
As I await my flight.
I wish on a star
For you tonight.

If there is a way it can be arranged -
When my time comes I'd like to, again, share a stage.

In mist full horizons
The darkness reeks fear
In the might of the mountains
Creatures concealed lurk in the shadows
Demons revealed, arise from the silence

Black voids in lifeless plains
Wake up dead in endless pain
Blood fills the surface

I need what keeps me warm inside

Stares from the mirror on the wall
You think you know my problems
I think that you don't know my at all

I don't believe I suffer
Disease as you proclaim
And I don't believe that I should kneel and hang my head in shame

Held prisoner by a monkey
Strapped on behind my back
And while I sit ablaze
The light is slowly fading into the black
So I

I've got to medicate myself again
I've got to medicate myself again
I've got to medicate myself again

Cause you don't need me hanging 'round
One more drink and I will be drowned

I know you hate to see me
As I defeat myself this way
You know you can't control me
You know I'm slipping day by day

Down into my obsession
Down in the hole where I belong
And when this fight is over
You will stay right here and I will be gone
So I

I've got to medicate myself again 3x

I found you broken
And lying on the floor
An empty bottle in the drain
I put my hand right through the kitchen door

I've got to medicate myself again
Cause you don't need me hanging 'round
I barely get my coat off and you're already
Crawling down my back again
Yeah you get to watch me sinking down
One more drink and I will be drowned

I've got to medicate myself again"

Know what I say is true, that I'm here because of you, I have lived on

And I let people down, and I wore a crown of being the biggest fool

So all you people know what I say is true, that I'm here because of you

Take this heart I've carved in stone

3291,TRAIXFB128F423C5A8.h5,Joy Division,Passover,"This is a crisis I knew had to come, destroying the balance I'd kept
Doubting, unsettling and turning around, wondering what will come next
Is this the role that you wanted to live? I was foolish to ask for so much
Without the protection and infancy's guard, it all falls apart at first touch

Watching the reel as it comes to a close, brutally taking its time
People who change for no reason at all, it's happening all of the time
Can I go on with this train of events disturbing and purging my mind?
Back out of my duties, when all's said and done. I know that I'll lose every time

Moving along in our God-given ways, safety is sat by the fire
Sanctuary from these feverish smiles, left with a mark on the door
Is this the gift that I wanted to give? Forgive and forget's what they teach
Or pass through the deserts and wastelands once more and watch as they drop by the beach

This is the crisis I knew had to come, destroying the balance I'd kept
Turning around to the next set of lives, wondering what will come next"

When you chose to sail away
Now take this seat and stay forever
And make me stop, can't tell the date

Lately I am sure you are doing well
Though I don't know how that feels

Believe In Me, after all
Believe in me, and the end becomes
There's a world behind these walls that I just need to see
Believe in me

Every dream that had been shattered
Disappears without a trace
Now that I have found what really matters, yeah
After you have gone away
Even though you have been doing well
Don't you hide behind a smile

And just believe in me, after
Believe in me, after

Let's get it in...

(Verse 1: Jay-Z)
Yeah ma, your dude is back,
The Maybach roof is back
Tell the whole world the truth is back
You ain't got to argue about who could rap
Cause the proof is back, just go through my raps
New York, New York! yeah where my troopers at?
Where my hustlers? where my boosters at?
I don't care what you do for stacks
I know the world glued you back to the wall
You gotta brawl through that

And I 'gon tell you again let's get ghost in the Phantom
You could bring your friend we could make this a tandem
You could come by yourself and you could stand him
Best believe I sweat out weaves,
Give afropuffs like R.A.G.E.
""Ha-u-git""* if you could move it
Back it on up like a U-Haul truck
Then run and tell them ducks you heard Hovi now shit
He and the boy Phar-real make beautiful music
He is to the east coast what Snoop is,
To the west coast what Face is to Houston
Young Hov in the house it's so necessary
No bra with the blouse it's so necessary
No panties and jeans that's so necessary
Now why you frontin on me? is that necessary?
Do I, to you, look like a lame
Who don't understand a broad with a mean shoe game
Whose up on Dot Dot Dot and Vera Wang
Ma are you insane? let's just

No bra with that blouse it's so necessary
No panties and jeans it's so necessary
Why you frontin on me?

Let's go to my hotel cause this don't go well
With those S Dots, try to stay fresh ma
Ma, I don't shop where the rest buy
Oh no ma please respect ma

Version 2 (from On Stage)
See the stars come falling down from the sky
Gently passing they kiss your tears that you cry
See the wind come softly blow your hair from your face
And the rain comes falling down in its crazy ways

Still I'm sad
Still I'm sad

For myself my tears just fall in the dust
Day will dry them and night will find they're lost
See the wind come softly blow time into my heart
And the rain comes falling down while we're apart

Still I'm sad
Still I'm sad

See the stars come falling down from the sky
Gently passing they kiss your tears that you cry
See the wind come softly blow your hair from your face
And the rain comes falling down in its crazy ways

I'm so sad
I'm so sad

But still I'm sad
Feeling so sad
Feeling so bad
You're making me sad
Making me bad
I'm sad

Version 3 (from Stranger In Us All)
See the stars come falling down from the sky 
Gently passing they kiss your tear drops dry
See the wind come softly blow your hair from your face
And the rain comes falling down in its crazy way

Still I'm sad

For myself my tears just fall in the dust
As I search in the night and find they're lost
See the wind come gently blow time into my heart
And the rain comes falling down while we're apart

Still I'm sad
Still I'm sad

See the stars come falling down from the sky 
Gently passing they kiss your tear drops dry
See the wind come softly blow your hair from your face
And the rain will come falling down in its crazy, crazy way

To the day I was your valentine
No halo over your head
We stayed at home and spent the day in bed
Your skin so hot to the touch
I never wanted anyone so much
You're a sight for sore eyes to see
Won't somebody come and rescue me

I've spent along time away
And it's good to be home
And together is better than being alone
It's a far cry from anything I've ever felt like before
Yes and long is the road
That's been leading me back to your door

A daydream out of the blue
Into something so sad but true
An old friend back from the dead
To steal the covers sleeping in your bed

I never meant to be an aggravation
I'm only looking for a second chance
I'm so hard-headed that determination
Left me all alone
That's why I'm coming home
Running all the way"

If tomorrow doesn't come, did we die for nothing?
Recounting past events has helped reveal that you don't give a damn about the days when you would live the words you wrote
Not the person who you were
I hate the person you've become
You inspired. Now expired, it has died for nothing

Some stop feeling love for all the places they come from
A person I will not become
A jaded liar, unforgivable
Some stop feeling love for every word that they once sung
May I never lose my youth and if I do, may I be forgettable

You said you started up this home because you didn't like the way these kinds of things were run
You've said you understand the work it takes to make us grow
If you had then where were you?
We've paid our dues without you
Am I the only one who sees all of the deceit and festering hypocrisy?

Don't ever talk to me like you think you know me or what I've been through
I am nothing like you!

In daylight we're oblivion
Our hearts so raw and clear
Are turning away, turning away from here

On water we have walked like the fearless child
What was fastened we've unlocked revealing wondrous wild
And in search for confirmation
We have jumped into the fire
And scrambled with our burning feet through uncontrolled desire

There's a well upon the hill from our ancient past
Where an age is standing still holding strong and fast
And there's those that try to tame it
And the carve it into stone
Ah but words cannot extinguish it
However hard they're thrown

On Racherie they have worked with their island dreams
By Lough Cleggan they have nourished in the mountain streams
And in searching for acceptance
They have given it away
Only the children of our children
Know the price they had to pay"

Has he thoughts within his head?

Why should we even care?

He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

Nobody helps him

Gave up His crown that we might be free
He chose a manger that Bethlehem night
And reaching through time and space He saw me

To live through urban grey
E is for the warm glow,
That takes the fear away

Show us what is better
Why don't you stand inside
These shoes
Oh live with me each Monday...
Let's see what you would do...

Which world do you live in?
Which world did you choose?
Hiding the tears, that's all
No win
No lose

I wanna tell you a little story about a party in this song...

It happened back in '93, in the PITTSBURG PUNK ROCK SCENE
An event that will go down, in infamy
It was all the masterplan, of one legendary PUNK ROCK KID
His name was ""Spaz"", S-P-A-Z

An eviction notice to his house sparked off an idea
""I should have one last party at my place...""
So off he set with his master plan, the invitation in his hand read:
""You're invited to my House Destruction Party!""

Spaz's House Destruction Party, it was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough to make the House Destruction Party then you know
You're lucky that you lived

Let's go!

We played there St. Patrick's Day with Submachine and THE BAD GENES
In a basement full of debris
From kicked in doors, broken glass, knocked in walls, THE PLACE WAS THRASHED
The house was now missing it's support beams

The bathrooms had no toilets or sinks left in them
There was nothing in the kitchen left to break
Aus Rotten spray painted on the walls, drunk punks passed out in the halls
And this was just the second night of the three-day long party

Spaz's House Destruction Party, it was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough to make the House Destruction Party then you know
You're lucky that you lived

The cops showed up and all the kids went piling out the back
I remember running away and hiding out in the lot behind the Squirrel Hill Mellon Bank
The cop said, ""I wanna speak to someone who lives here!"" and this punk kid said she did
He asked, ""Is this the condition the house has always been in?""
She answered, ""Uh... yeah, it is.""

Spaz's House Destruction Party, it was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough to make the House Destruction Party then you know
You're lucky that you lived

I hear the flapping of wings,
The bestoking tranquillity of irredescent spectrum,
The birds circle around my presence,
Hinting at pale sightings of Kadmos,
All alone for dust ridden aeons,
Alienation Your inner method of nirvana,
There is no night, no day -
Kadmos Your preserved brotherhood,
The ivory Your only solace,
In flight we persevere into the lights of the ivory plains,
Structures from silence,
Petals in the stream,
Murk above the dark moor,
The eastwinds brush the dust from Your prophetic throne,
In lands of I never saw,
Where the equinox was permanent,
The elephants trun the icon of Your only existence,
For their is nothing else,
In flight we persevere into the mists of ivory plains,
Foregather in the name of Moros and remember our lands."

Some folks drift along through life and never thrill
To the feeling that a good deed brings until
It's too late and they are ready to lie down
There beneath the leaves that's scattered on the ground

Lord, let my eyes see every need of every man
Make me stop and always lend a helping hand
Then when I'm laid beneath that little grassy mound
There'll be more friends around than leaves upon the ground

To your grave there's no use taking any gold
You cannot use it when it's time for hands to fold
When you leave this earth for a better home someday
The only thing you'll take is what you gave away"

I get funky like diaper rash and
You know I'm mad spunky and I'm makin' cash

I've got sex rhymes like Victoria got secrets
To all you porn peepers who are trying to peep this
I'm like Al Goldstein I'm all about screwin'
Lead my team to sixty wins like my man Pat Ewing

Like gettin' shot out the barrel of a wave
Like a virgin POW on the peaks of A.K.
Like a sound that goes the depths of the soul
That's the feelin' that I make my goal

Uh
Check it out

A little wine with my dinner so I'm in my grape Ape
'I feel like a winner when I make a mix tape
Cause, I get ill when I'm on the pause button
And I get my fill and now you can't say nothin'

More soul on this train than Don Cornelious
I got the mad subwoofer pumpin' bass for your anus
Just gettin' on the mic at the monthly function
Wires hittin' switches connectin' at the junction

Pearlman's got beats and it ain't no secret

With lovers and friends

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them

And I'll do all I can to please you

I said there ain't no woman like the one I got
Yes I know, I know

There was a time when my heart was dragging on the floor
And I thank God for the day that I saw your face and you
Smiled at me
And you took my hand and you stole my heart away

I lost all my friends
'Cause I ain't got time left for them

Because there ain't no woman likke the one I got

I don't have a lot, but I'm proud of what I've got
I can't complain
'Cause I see people hangin' round, on the city streets downtown
Living on pocket change
There're times I've been confused, felt that I was born to lose
Oh but I survived
Unlike the one's who pray and feel more than blessed each day
To just be still alive

Is there something we can do
Seems the odds against survival are a million to one
The only hope they have will die
In the hearts of you and I if nothing's ever done
I can't save them by myself
Oh but God forbid that I just turn my head
And walk on by
Don't let me be a stranger to those less fortunate than I

Seems that old golden rule, that I learned back in school
Has lost its shine
It's a crying shame, and I wonder could the blame
Be yours and mine
Discipline was tough, and that old principal was rough
But the times were good
'Cause no one ever found one single child shot down
In the neighborhood

Is there something we can do
Seems the odds against survival are a million to one
'Cause every day that passes by
Another street gang victim dies
And still there's nothing done
I can't save them by myself
Oh but God forbid that I just run away somewhere and hide
From the fear and the danger of those less fortunate than I
Lord don't let me be a stranger to those less fortunate than I"

I was alone out there, with no one else around
Now I've fallen for you, and there's no coming down

Till there was you, I know what you're needing
My thoughts are leading, me straight into your eyes
What can I do? I'm looking right at you
This feeling is all new, I want you addicted to me

Fate can act in a curious way
When all that mattered means nothing today
All that concerns me, that drenches my thoughts
Is the sensation that seeing you brought

I was alone out there, with no one else around
Now I've fallen for you, and there's no coming down

Love shines through, love shines through

Now I'm a little older
And nothing else could ever smolder
This burning fire

They say that love grows colder
And fairy tales are life's own fables
They're all a lie

That I hear the little things You say
Love shines through me and now, it consumes me
I cannot believe what You're doing for me, oh

Love shines through every day
Reminds me of the way
You entered right into my heart and soul
Love shines through, love shines

And every little thing You do
Is evidence You're true, I believe You

Love shines through every day
Reminds me of the way
You entered right into my heart and soul
Love shines through, love shines through

Such an urgency
That we need each other
So desperatly oh can't you see

It's a long way home
It's a long way home
Lets walk together
Instead of alone
On this long way home

I've gone through the pages
Of a lot of magazines
Full of angry looking rockstars
And airbrushed beauty queens
And next to each picture
Is a caption that read
Oh your life will be better
If you have what we have
And the message grows louder
As we fall further from grace

So lets speak to each other
Of a better place

Oh 'cause it's a
Long way home
It's a long long way home
Lets walk together

And ought to be restored before it dies

I have seen you walking in the rain
I wanted to know why you were crying
I wanna fix what's wrong...

It must be love the sailor sails for
Must be love that drives a bottle to the bottom of the ocean floor
Because I imagine all kinds of wonderful water
I would have you there wherever I'll go
Way from the seventh sea,
He brings the bottle back to me
Oh, It Must Be Love
Oh, It Must Be Love
People look through evervthing thev see
There's so many other things to be
I have seen you walking in the rain
I want to know whv vou were crying
Baby, let me fix what's wrong...

It must be love that fathoms the moonlight
Must be love that shallovvs
The deepest part of the night
So you can show them vvith vour eye
The things that make them cry,
Because that Must Be Love
It Must Be Love...
And the way you are
Must Be Love
And the things vou Feel
Oh, It Must Be Love,
Oh, It Must Be Love
Must Be Love"

On that hand there's no reason, why it's wrong

But on the other hand, there's a golden band
To remind of someone, who would not understand
On one hand I could stay, and be your lovin' man
But the reason I must go, is on the other hand

In your arms I feel the passion, I thought had died
When I looked into your eyes, I found myself
And when I first kissed your lips, I felt so alive
I've got to hand it to you girl, you're somethin' else

But on the other hand, there's a golden band

When I'm battling the moments when I wish I was dead
When my mind and body feel like fire and stone
And I know I'm gonna spend all my life alone

That's when I need to cover up my heart and soul
I only gain perspective when I lose control
Is it better to be crying when you feel insane
Or laughing out loud dancing naked in the rain

Have you ever felt a thunder deep inside your heart

Lost my coffee cup
Make things disappear
Then I make things up
I lost you, then I lost my way
And I make it difficult for you to say the things you want to say

I am right, right in the eye, of the storm, and I am wondering why

I have been watching, oh I I've been watching you
There are so many, so many secrets I've been keeping too

Open the coffin, there's nothing inside
There are fake stars shining in the sky
And when I wake up I find I am still dreaming
In the bathtub, the salmon are teeming

Maybe I need to see something grow
See black soil, green shoots
Maybe I need to touch down
I need heavier boots

I have been watching, oh I I've been watching you
There are so many, so many secrets I've been keeping too

Somehow the spaces between the words grew
How long till there are no more traces of you

You found my phone, found my coffee cup
You made things appear, as if the rain fell up
Does it come down to laundry and dishes
Do these desires become impossible wishes"

Aus dem Papamobil mit get√∂nten Scheiben 
Du kannst gerne schreien, die W√§nde sind schalldicht 
Du kannst f√ºr mich testen, wie kalt es im Wald ist 
Komm mich besuchen, mein Zimmer ist die Zelle 8-8 
Ich habe viel Platz, mein Zimmerkollege ist nicht aufgewacht 
Er h√§ngt von der Decke, doch der Hurensohn tropft 
Du willst rennen, komm und renne ohne Beine, ohne Kopf 
Ich mach keine Gefangenen, aber lebendige M√∂bel 
Deine Mutter sucht Geld, sie erkennt dich beim Tr√∂del 
Meine Freunde, die V√∂gel, picken die Reste auf 
Ich hab eine meiner Vogelscheuchen-Masken auf 
Ich zieh mir deine Haut √ºber meinen Kopf 
Denn ich mach mit deiner Braut im Wald ein Picknick 
Jeder meiner Leute will mal auf sie rauf 
Und ich gebe jedem ein St√ºck mit 
Deine immer nasse, frische Mutter sucht im Internet nach hei√üen Exoten 
Ich komme mit Grabstein zum Rendezvous 
Direkt zur√ºck von den Toten 
Ich habe keine Zeit mehr, die Sonne geht auf 
Mein Ende naht, ich mauer meine Fenster zu 
Und male meine W√§nde schwarz

Es ist Walpurgisnacht, ich breche aus der Klapse aus 
Setze meine Schweinekopf-Maske auf 
Raste aus 
Ab jetzt hast du vier V√§ters
K.I.Z., Triebt√§ters

Triff mich mit Klampfe unter dei'm Fenster, Baby, ich sing ""Mi amore"" 
Seh schei√üe aus, doch ich ficke dich trotzdem, Nico (Nico!) Briatore 
Der Teufel tr√§gt Prada, Gott tr√§gt Picaldi 
Deine Mutter verkauft ihre Fotze vor Aldi 
Rein in den Club, Schw√§nze in die H√∂h' 
Deine Braut hat meine Wurst drin, Cordon bleu 
T√∂t√∂r√∂t√∂, riesiger R√ºssel, riesiger Hass, riesiger Appetit 
Du denkst, du bist mit deiner Frau bei IKEA, denn sie hat sich in einen Schrank verliebt 
Mit Messer und Gabel, die Schweinekopf-Maske auf meinem Gesicht durch das Fenster 
Der Bonhoeffer rostet im Norden Berlins, vertrauenserweckender Tremper 
Massimo ist da, ich fahre mit Wodka im Getriebe 
Von dem ersten Vorschuss kaufe ich mir eine Niere 
Und 'ne neue Leber und 'ne neue Lunge, Tarek, bitte, bitte, mach ein Backup, denn ich hyperventiliere 
Und wenn sie nicht ficken will, denk ich mir: Schei√ü drauf! 
Nimm den Penis und erwische sie mit einem Streifschuss 
Deine Alte sammelt jedes Wochenende Pilze, aber nicht im Wald

Die Sonne scheint mir (mir, mir) aus dem Arsch 
Dein Album scheint mir (mir, mir) ganz sch√∂n schei√üe zu sein

Es ist Walpurgisnacht, ich breche aus der Klapse aus 
Setze meine Schweinekopf-Maske auf

Ab jetzt hast du vier V√§ters

Ich bin aufgestylt, Polo-Hemd, Pedik√ºre, Manik√ºre, Gurkenmaske 
Braungebrannt bei Solarent, ich mache mich sch√∂n, bevor ich Huren schlachte 
Geisterstunde, Zeit f√ºr meine Runde 
Skinhead Black will ein Menschenopfer 
Salzs√§ure in meiner Wasserpistole, ein typischer K.I.Z.-Schenkelklopfer 
Hasse den Bunker, nach dieser CD bist du Untermieter in meiner Hundeh√ºtte 
H√§ng deine goldene Platte an die Wand, wir haben Platinteller in der Unterlippe 
Jetzt gibt es ein neuen Boss in dei'm Haus 
Tarek, K.I.Z., hat das Schloss ausgetauscht 
Du h√∂rst zu √ºber die Sprechanlage 
Wie ich deine Schwester mit Salz und Pfeffer jage 
Dein Papa mein neuer Geldgeber 
Meiner sieht aus wie der Hellraiser 
Ich hole dich ab wie ein Feldj√§ger 
Gott ist ein Schiri und gab mir Elfmeter, denn ich bin ein Pimp, auf meinem Sack ein Pentagramm 
Nenn mich den Sex-Terroristen, denn ich spreng dein' Darm

Die Sonne scheint mir (mir, mir) aus dem Arsch 
Dein Album scheint mir (mir, mir) ganz sch√∂n schei√üe zu sein

todo lo que perd√≠
eso no es para mi
material de vida,
botellas y almas queridas
que la noche sublima
en su medialuz.
Antes de ser var√≥n
yo se que fui mujer
lo siento al recordar
algunos tramos
cuando me miro las manos
y son de un lejano
pais de otra piel.

Nostalgia de otra vida
carb√≥n que da la mina
la fuerza necesaria para arder
y en los ojos del espacio
va silvandome despacio
que soy trigo
pa' que otros puedan comer,
esto no termina nunca
el amor es la pregunta
y si estuve en otra vida fui mujer.
Conozco la canci√≥n
falsia del querer
la tr√°gica comedia de la hombria

y el dol√≥r los obliga
a llorar como mujer."

My body's tired, but my thoughts are running deep
I guess I know just what you're going through
Because I kind of feel the same way too
Looking back, there was nothing we could do

It's not easy what you're going through
You call me up, and I'm still wondering what to do
We both admit that it's gone too far
We're just trying to find out who we are
Lonely nights is something that I don't want to see

Now you're free and living fast
It's not easy looking at the past
It gets harder every day when you're running away

Running away

Looking back we shared a lot
Is it worth it all to let go of what we got
All at once you can't ignore the fact
Some where some how we got off the track
Give it up, it's changing you and changing me

If we have the chance to turn the clock back
Who knows how or when
Would it happen all again

Now you're free and living fast
It's so tough to make a good thing last
It get's harder everyday when you're running away

It's not easy living on your own
You miss your friends you want to go back home
It gets harder everyday when you're running away

Got to give the people
Give the people what they want
Ladies and Gentlemen

Verse One: Erick Sermon

When I came out with my first rap jam
I had no idea that the record would slam
It did real good without radio play
Maybe at night but no airplay in the day
I couldn't understand why to be exact
Our music was good and I was far from wack
Then came the answer, commercial was the key
To get airplay and a spot on TV
Like Ed Lover and Doctor Dre from Yo! MTV Raps
A show, mainly for the black
And still we can't ill, cause to them that's wrong
Cause like P.E. said, we're too black and too strong
But hey, what can I say
(Brothers and sisters) that's a price a rapper must pay

Verse Two: PMD

As airwaves collapse rap shows at a standstill
Some racial circuits the frequencies can't handle
The funk tracks produced by EPMD
But it's a fat jam, that will never win a grammy
Unless we sellout and kill the black movement dead
Which means swallow our pride and become flunkies instead
And stop the rap about freedom, thoughts of a black president
And rap about a black crack, the mayor in our residence
Give me a break brothers, it's time to take a stand
And kill that no sir, yes sir, and thank you ma'am
'Cause the word is a luxury a black man can't afford
That's why poverty's on the rise and we still ignored
And it's a setback and yet the clock still ticks
And if we let it, rap would be run by politics
I read it somewhere that every man's created equal
But not in this day and age, maybe in the sequel
Which means next time, so observe these rhymes
And take a stand and go for yours 'cause I'm going for mine
That's why I

Verse Three: Erick Sermon, PMD

Why is that when wrong is done by the black
It's blown out of proportion and immediately attacked
By the press and yes, conflict is caused
By the kids at concerts who bumrush the doors
One child gets hurt, the press gets pesty
But what about the Beatles, G, and Elvis Presley
Same stuff was rough, rap does not cause violence
So (Fight the Power) and make them understand
But too much power and you might get banned
So if you want airplay
You can't be too black and hey, watch what you say, but ayo

Because I know I've seen what the others should have to see
Who left the light in these blinded eyes?

The fight our mothers and fathers could
They rocked the system and changed their lives

I turned my face away
It's the only way to see what I am
So I don't have to breathe

Tell me when did I go wrong?

Innocence is lost
And hopes are shattered

You were so blind to let me go
You had it all but did not know
No one you'll find will ever be
Closer to all your dreams than me

Believing the grass would be greener
You told yourself, ""I just don't need her now.""
But I know you'll soon discover
You're never satisfied with any other

Someday, ooh someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey, hey
Boy you're gonna pay, 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

You'll change your mind and call my name
Soon as you find they're all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don't come back crying, you should have known

Believe me, I'm not pretending
It's not hard to predict this ending now
'Cause I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me in spite of all the others

Someday, ooh someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey, hey
Boy you're gonna pay, 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

(Someday, ooh someday)
(One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for)
(Someday, hey, hey)
(Boy you're gonna pay, 'cause) baby I'm the one who's keeping score

Maybe now you just can't conceive
That there'll ever come a time when you're cold and lonely
Baby, how could you ever believe
That another could replace me, the one and only

But when you're down in your time of need
And you're thinking that you
Might be coming back to own me
Just think again 'cause
I won't need your love anymore

Someday, ooh someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey, hey
Boy you're gonna pay, 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

Ever so nervously, people lookin' down on me, telling me it's all right

If it were up to me I'd tear down this whole city, what's all this shit here for?
I give you my heart, but you just say I make you feel like a whore

All this trouble just to die, all this trouble's only temporary, it's temporary, temporary

Took away his power but he hides a tiny flower in the corner of his jail cell
Never been outside he just can't hide, he'd just assume be in hell

Get off the fucking telephone, why'd you hate to be alone, paranoid of death and love
Ever so patiently we sit upon our sinking ship waiting for the black dove

All this trouble just to die, all this trouble's only temporary, it's temporary, temporary

Sad that I could make it, glad that I could fake, sorry but I got to go
I ain't afraid of cryin', ain't afraid of dyin'. ain't afraid of what I don't know"

It's the promise that keeps you warm

Instead you ran away

And let me feel the vibe you're on
Come lay your head on me
And everything will be all right

You'll be coming clean tonight
And I'll be falling down with you once again
Call me your valentine, call me once tonight
And haven't said that it's okay

The things you said, I'm rehearsing them

They went back on us

I could know him to come on to it
It's the thought that emerges
(Take back couldn't step it up)
I could never love, the idle thing

Bury your head
Has the child smashed you down
And the psalms will never call me again

I'll sleep tonight

Sold right and all
They wandered around and round my mouth,
They stole my life

I dreamt you took me to the river
And I woke up baptized in Your light

I'm giving my love to You only
I'm giving my love, my love, giving my sweet soul love
I know with you I'll never know lonely
I'm giving my love, my love, giving my sweet soul love

Now that all my prayers are answered
Let me show you what faith can do
I never let myself believe in forever
Till I met You, it's true. I do
You Took the burden off my shoulders
So I can always be praising you

Not lost, not thrown away
Just irritated and quite hated

Why's everything so tame?
I like my life insane
I'm barricading and debating
Who I'm gonna kick around

Right now, can't find a way to get across the hate when I see you
Right now, I feel it scratch inside, I wanna slash and beat you
Right now, I rip apart the things inside that excite you
Right now, I can't control myself, I fucking hate you

I'm feeling cold today
Not hurt, just fucked away
I'm devastated and frustrated
God I feel so bound

So when I feel the need
I think it's time to bleed
I'm gonna cut myself
A watch the blood
Hit the ground

Right now, can't find a way to get across the hate when I see you
Right now, I feel it scratch inside, I wanna slash and beat you
Right now, I rip apart the things inside that excite you
Right now, I can't control myself, I fucking hate you

You open your mouth again
I swear I'm gonna break it
You open your mouth again
My God I cannot take it

Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up

Let that playa ass nigga Twista be your guide as we go on a ride
Where playa hatin' killers and the hood niggaz thrive
And lame motherfuckers can barely survive

One morning I woke up next to a thick bitch
Took a shower dried off brushed the gold teeth like Slick Rick
Tapped on Obsession colonge like Doug E. Fresh in the flesh
Think I'm blessed with the zest after slippin on my slick fit
The high discover me, hit the front porch
Two women butterly lovely in front of me got my head gone
I sent the bitch in the bed home 'cause one of them
Got chocolate big thighs and the other one was a redbone
Where y'all goin' y'all thick as hell
What's your name I wanna get up with y'all tonight shit
I got some homies that lonely never phony we on some hype shit
Call up the buddies you be tight with
We ain't really gon be doin' too much though
We just ridin' around bumpin sounds trippin' out while we flame janes
Tappin the horn at the homies that gangbang
And slang 'caine to maintain to mob's the same thing
Or we can chill at the crib and play spades or kick some ass a bit
Speedpass the clit and get passionate
Grab the buckle and unfasten it
And we can get into some ol' nasty shit
Live if I could decide to try, don't play me bogus
This ain't no spin move and I ain't got no time to lie
Tell your girls we gonna be sliding by
But hit the weed tip first cause my clique got to be riding high
Cause it feels so good

It feels so good how we kick it in the hood like so good
(When we ridin' high)
Rollin' through the hood with Phillies and hoes
Straight pimpin' with nowhere to go
And it feels so good the way we kick it in the hood like so good
(When we ridin' high)
Rollin' through the hood with Phillies and hoes
Straight pimpin' with nowhere to go

Me and my homies hooked up some cowards took up
When niggas we lust smokin' some but the flame tight
Trippin' off how we survivin the rugged terrain
And try to hang tight getting fucked up on gang night
Used to be gang fights now we gotta try to relax with the scrap
Even we sent Deebo back to back to back
We still be holdin' stacks of packs
Rollin' through wit black blacks, blunt reds, ash trays, and crack sacks
Hustlin and chillin's what I'm focusin on
Fiendin through bitch's cribs hopin it's on
If ain't no strokin we strollin along
Rollin' the chrome out really trippin'
Because we take the smoke to the dome
Bumpin the tunes while bigger roles and herringbones
Glisten from all the sunlight
Peepin the fe's with their hair done tight
Booty hung right and every night we see at least one fight
Hookin up with my fellow Westside cliques
Now together we mush
But when are we strapped through and rug cutters
Just like the envy and jealousy throughout the other is love brothers
Ridin' every one of y'all my muhfuckers
So put the Black Magic on the tires and get the wax off the chrome
We gon' to blaze on till my brain's blown
Hopin to get my thang on
Not matter what block you stay on kick it
Round the world it's the same song
(So the Mobsters just flame on)
For scratch we was willin' to squirt some blood
Now we got up on hittin the 'cause
From stealin' tips where they're swum the doves
Mo' we got up on some bud
Straight hittin' up the block searching for love
Reach up and hit the deep lung then we gone
Smokin' delight the body right what the party like
Are you as live as I come roll with meso we can ride the sky
But only if you let me play with you while we ridin' high
Cause it feels so good

Sittin' back cruising through the slow breeze
Thinkin' how can I get mo' cheese
Bumpin a system costin 4 G's
I stay on my P's for the po-P's
Split the Phillie with my door keys
Scoop a female to the crib good get my boy to bring a blessin through
Sit on the floor playin' Tekken 2
Lesson two I'm adressin you
Turn out the lights like the World Class Wreckin' Crew
Bring out the best in you
Confessin true lies about your inner thighs
And where they been hopin maybe you be my lady
What's the potatoes without the gravy
What you feelin' on maybe soft with the silicone baby
But can you pay me?
Cause daily we be riding in the dope stroll
While rockin' dope flows I'll lose the spot if I choose to stop
We can cruise some blocks and talkin' about
How later on you comin' out your clothes, shoes and socks
Now is that news or not?
Come I step on the gas slow and smoke on this last ""O""
Get a ""B"" and split it now watch me kill it
Tinted windows took a sealin' off in the Astro
On billets take a choke on so I can really feel it
Thinkin' about not having the rich life
But the hood life was still a good life
And that we know always and forever though
For ever more rollin' in the ghetto with nowhere to go
And it feels so good"

Remove all gods from my way, and thoughts, and sorrows
And let me trespass the barriers of fear

Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend.
I'm not thinking 'bout him, but you married him
Do you know I made him leave
Do you know he begged to stay, with me
He wasn't man enough for me

Didn't he tell you the truth?
If not then why don't you ask him
Then maybe you can be more into him
Instead of worrying about me
And hopefully you won't buy

And why we couldn't work it out

How everybody's got a dream but they feel they won't win
'Cause somebody who was willin', who wanted to be chillin'
So they could never make it even if they were willin'
So we threw together this old school flow
So everybody in my generation oughta know
No matter what we take from this scene

Who worked the rivers run
His wife would cook his meals,
As he would check the wheels.

Singin' poor Tom, Seventh Son,
Always knew what's goin' on.

Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom
And there ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom.

He worked for thirty years
Sharin' hopes 'n' fears
Dreamin' of the day
He could turn and say

Poor Tom, work's gone,
Lazin' out in the noonday sun.

Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom
And there ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom.

His wife was Emmie May
One of many games she played
When Tom was out of town,
She couldn't keep her dresses down.

A-poor Tom, Seventh Son,
Always knew what's goin' on.

Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom
And there ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom.

And so it was one day
People got to Emmie May
A-Tom took a gun in his hand
And stopped all the runnin' around.

Poor Tom, Seventh Son,
Gotta die for what you've done.

All those years of work are thrown away.
To ease your mind, is that all you can say?
But what about that grandson on your knee?
And then wrote songs as well as he could be.

Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
And there ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
And there ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
And there ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom.

Threw stones at your window

I'm missing my sweet pea
Airports and handkerchiefs
And broken families

Went very far away
Some people, they don't hurt
Just in it for the chase

Be sure that you're certain

For flirtation and free loving

Think of how I called your name out loud
Think of how if you weren't so proud
You could be my lover

And then when your plane touches solid ground
And the taxi whisks you on into town
In the glittering lights I'll be all around
'Cause we belong with each other

Oh, I'll go anywhere anytime
I'll go anywhere anytime honey
I'll go anywhere anytime

Take a warm coat for the snow

The air no longer in my throat, another perfect lie is choked but it always feels the same

So they close together, dressed in red and yellow, innocent forever. Sleeping children in their blue soft rooms still dream

Hmm, it looks like we're in for some stormy weather, baby
But that ain't no cause for us to leave
Just lie right here in my arms
And let it wash away the pain
And it feels like rain

Feels like rain
Feels like rain
Ah, sho'nuff feel like rain
I think you better just stay right here tonight, baby
Oh yeah
'Cause it looks like, looks like rain out there tonight, baby
Hmm, I think we just gotta stay right here
Let me just keep you comfort tonight

And worship You alone

A song begins to rise
Until it overflows

You are holy, You are holy
I will lift my voice to you
And sing it with the angels
You are holy, You are holy
We will offer you our praise
In a mighty chorus
You are holy, You are holy
Wonderful in all your ways
Holy You are holy Lord

When your love breaks through
And I am swept away
By just a glimpse of you

When you make me new
Till I'm nothing less than
What I find in You

You are holy, You are holy
I will lift my voice to you
And sing it with the angels
You are holy, You are holy
We will offer you our praise
In a mighty chorus
You are holy, You are holy
Wonderful in all your ways
Holy You are holy Lord

Unto the One
Who sits on the Throne
And unto the Lamb
Be all blessing and honor
Glory and Power and Praise

And in heaven and earth
We make known

Wonderful in all your ways

Yeah... Once again
It's like this...

AotP, we runnin' this rap shit now
Celph Titled, we runnin' this rap shit now
ES, we runnin' this rap shit now
Warchild, niggas runnin' this rap shit now

(Verse 1: Celph Titled)
It's about to be a motherfuckin' slaughter in this bitch
We got the awfullest clips, rusty burners with the rotten rubber grips
We some hardcore crooks, drinkin' rubbing alcohol
Never use a rubber at all, we fuckin' bitches raw
Chokin' up your faculty, turn your whole ""gang green""
Unload the magazine to your knees, give you a gangsta lean
Military minded, on the A-Train with a deranged brain
I was buildin' the walls of hell way before the flames came
And bitches love me with a MAC-11
Tellin' the police sketch artist I look like Jon B. with a deadly weapon
Keepin' it ghetto even when it's war, ock
Rockin' jean shorts and a tanktop, loadin' shells in the tank top
Aimin' the cannon to blast you where you standin'
You could be in Montana campin', but your head'll land in the Hamptons
Won't grin for the camera when you clickin' it at me
But I'll smile with a gun in my hand, I'm trigger happy

[Chorus: Crypt the Warchild + Vinnie Paz] (x2)
Listen up, it's murder music till your wrist is cut
Fire octane, nigga y'all can sip it up
We do this rap shit here so we can live it up
We walk around with hot flames runnin', give it up

(Verse 2: Esoteric)
You could never fathom the level beyond your God or your Devil
If every thought is a pebble (my style's boulder, I told you)
A radical rebel and yes the jacket's full-metal
And men I'm hackin' through several (I'm like a soldier, I'll fold you)
A blow to your composure, heat of the moment
I be meat-cleavin' a bleedin' opponent, he didn't want it
These heathens try to eat off me but they repeatedly clone it
This industry is mine, I can put my feet way up on it
I put my people up on it, my sinister and lethal ministry of evil
Turn a Vinnie Diesel to a skinny weasel
I'm the pinnacle and steeple of this faction, feeble men I'm smashin'
Playin' God? you ain't Jim Caviezel with The Passion
Automatic how I'm causin' havoc, I body maggots
Who thought they brought the static, they probably addicts
And fiendin' for a bag of this antagonistic savageness
You talkin' platinum but ain't crackin' pitchers' batting averages

(Verse 3: Crypt the Warchild)
Don't make me get your fuckin' face broken
I ain't jokin' when I'm flamethrowin'
I'll spit a verse at you to slit your fuckin' veins open
I'll spit a curse or two just to keep the rain pourin'
I'll lift the skirt of you to see you pussies ain't workin'
I'll live to murder you until I see the game's over
We never heard of you and 'cause of that, the name's worshipped
(It's the Army, cocksuckas) Get it correct
Or y'all can find sharp things straight embedded in necks
I rep my team to the death, I will slice your people
Wave my flags in the air, plus the knives are lethal
Hottest shit to hit the streets since Nas did Ether
Now we pick at your soul and let your conscience eat ya
And take over, Crypt, Es, and Celph
You reap what you sow, so protect ya health, NIGGA

(Vinnie Paz)
Yeah muthafuckas! That's how we get fuckin' down

Cats don't want her to keep that dress on

Take her to the telly and make her a victim

'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever

Got a girl at home but he don't care
Won't care (won't care), all you do is keep me at home
Won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home
I won't be gettin' it on
And now I'm finding numbers
In the jacket pockets
Chicks calling the house non-stop
It's getting out of control
Finally I can't take no more
He finds a letter on the stairs
Saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone
Best believe we gone forever

With the ways of a gentleman I've been told
The kind of fellow that wouldn't even harm a flee

But if me and a certain character met
The guy that invented the cigarette
I'd murder that son-of-a-gun in the first degree

Cause, it ain't cause I don't smoke myself
And I don't reckon into your health
I've smoked them all my life and I ain't dead yet

But nicotine slaves are all the same
At a pettin' party or a poker game
Everything's gotta stop while they smoke the cigarette

Smoke, smoke, smoke that cigarette
Puff, puff, puff and if you smoke yourself to death

Tell St. Peter at the Golden Gate
That you hates to make him wait
You've gotta have another cigarette

In a game of chance the other night
Old Dame Fortune was doin' me right
The kings and the queens just kept on comin' around

I got a full and I bet 'em high
But my bluff didn't work on a certain guy
He just kept on raisin' and layin' that money down

He'd raise me, I'd raise him
I sweated blood, you gotta sink or swim
He finally called, didn't raise the bet

I said ""aces full pal, how 'bout you?""
He said ""I'll tell you in just a minute or two
Right now, I just gotta have myself a cigarette""

Smoke, smoke, smoke that cigarette
Puff, puff, puff and if you smoke yourself to death

Tell St. Peter at the Golden Gate
That you hates to make him wait
You've gotta have another cigarette

The other night I had me a date
With the cutest little gal on East 50 States
One 'em high-bred, uptown, fancy little dames

She said she loved me and it seemed to me
That everything's were like it oughta be
So hand in hand we strolled down lover's lane

She was oh so far from a chunk of ice
Our smoochin' party was goin' real nice
So help me, Hannah I'm thinking I've been there yet

I give her a kiss, a little squeeze
She said, ""Tex, excuse me please

As eerie constellations told before
This time you cannot hide
A maelstrom of inhuman fears
And the only way goes down... down... down...

Gone days of phantasmagoria
Welcome to the necromantic gallery
Where nightmares become so real
And souls are stigmatized with the sign of impurity

Desolation all around
Welcome to the promised land
Where no single beam of light ever touched the ground
Life eternal in a traumatic fade

Believe me this is not a dream
These dead eyes you are gazing at are yours
Call it heaven, call it hell...

Call it heaven, call it hell...
This is where the restless dwell!
Call it heaven, call it hell...

Black faces and only shades of grey
Distorted incantations
And prayers for aeons unheard

And I'm waiting for the Lord oh please don't leave me forsaken
Caught up in the doom prepare for Satan
We facing a situation while I'm drunk and scared
Heavily sedated wonder will I make it to the pearly gates
Or will I burn off in that lake now,
Could you feel the earthquake shaking the dead awake
How many wait it's too late it's over now
Niggas had a lack of faith so life ain't straight, if you incapable,
Having a little trouble a day wid ah fiend or somethin'
Betta plead to bloody Jesus
Watch how the majesty control it
Don't let it go slow down hold on
Now can I get a witness shout Hallelujah, Amen
I'm feeling the Holy Ghost makin' moves through ya
Smooth, I made it to free your mind to the rhythm

Making me nauseous cautious these niggas is flossing

Keeping real niggas rewinding this,
Deep in the ghetto in the streets ah Cleveland

Money and guns stacked up to the ceiling
Nigga get down for his hustle his hustle hustle
Now nigga now what ya gon' do when they come for you
Well I'ma tell ya right now what we gon' do

Open and close just like a case

I'm knowing they want me to catch it in war
Boy boy I seek and destroy any nigga that throw the decoy
See me I'm stacked and ripping shit
Taking off my shirt and breaking them sweats
Tattoos all over my body 7 on the stomach,
Skull on my chest, Nine millimetre in my pocket
Ready to buck on the crowd,
As long as that one little nigga

Talking about he 'bout it 'bout it

For marrow rip through thine spine

Hey gotta pay intuition,
This ain't no free exploit of an exhibit

Crack through your heart and take the evil apart

From the end of the earth unto you I call, time and again I fall, back to you I crawl
You have been a refuge for me, a tower of strength in the face of the enemy
Enemy, enemy lines I find I let myself get tied up too many times
You can't have my heart I'm taking back what's mine
I know it lie just smoke in your eye and you saved my soul from the other side

When faint grows my heart to a rock that too hard for me to climb alone lead me
For you have been a refuge

With you I smash a troop and with my G-d I leap over a wall
May the king answer you on the day that you call
Stand tall, battle yawl, the clouds crawl low, all stalled,
Heavens lay draped over New York like a prayer shawl,
The holy one enthroned upon the praises of Israel

And sing her a song
It feels like there's no safe place
In a world that's come apart
And the deafening sound of a bursting bubble
Wakes you up with a start
Is there nowhere that is safe
Why can't we change the rules so I win
All I need is an escape
A temporary place to hide
When she's coming in the door when she's walking out the door
Hard to tell which is worse
That false feeling of relief when she comes in
Or the empty feeling when she's gone
And every night on the streets the forces of darkness
Score another victory
And I stand with the timid waiting for the devil
To make a martyr of me
Fold up the tents and load up the trucks
'Cause it's time to move on
If we only knew where to go
I hope that we'd already be gone
And even when we're lying together, I make sure she falls asleep first
It seems when things are at their best, my mind starts to wander
To things at their worst

Don't put no flowers by my final bed.

Don't bring flowers after I'm dead.
Don't bring flowers after I'm dead.
Save your givings for the living instead.
Don't bring flowers after I'm dead."

How was I supposed to know our love would grow

Move a little closer
Be sure I'm looking up
Heal me with your loving

Fall the wall, And build a bridge

He seems to work against me any way he can
And he's been dealing tear-drops since the world began
And occasional pain

And blue you, don't believe I'm talking to you
The light is shining through you- still you will not see
Blue you- think I'm trying to undo you

The crops failed, the well ran dry
When they lost the watershed

A baby dies, its mother cries, the children gather 'round
They're wondering what the day will bring
Will they be the next one found?

Do you dare to gaze into their hollow eyes, hollow eyes?
Are they staring holes in you with their hollow eyes,
Hollow eyes, hollow eyes?

In the crowded sheds the children lay their heads
To escape the Haitian heat
The hunger pains drive them to the street
Wond'ring if today they'll eat
Some find food in the refuse heap, others find disease
Some find it harder just to live when they can die with ease.

The least of these is hungry.
The least of these is sick.
The least of these needs clothing.
The least of these needs drink.
The least of these knows sorrow.
The least of these knows grief.
The least of these has suffered pain, and Jesus is His name.

Is He staring back at you with His hollow eyes,
Hollow eyes, hollow eyes?"

Drenched in self-righteousness I'm letting go of apathy, I won't put up the front of a victim anymore.
So sick of cheap excuses from everyone I know I'm scattering the ashes of who I was.
Letting go of the person I used to be looking back and laughing at what I once believe.
Escaping the plagues of my life, and letting go of my regret, I'm casting my past in the flood forgetting every line we spent.
With death in my hands I'll clean myself of this. (2x)

Follow again one single piece
Of dream afar
Spent my all whole life there,
Chasing the hope

A drive so strong,
So deep I cannot see the end
Inborn sense of finding
What's beyond, in the furious storm

Reunifying with air and soil I am part of
Distant yet so close!

Longing for a whisper
That would carry me away
Faced my ultimate desire that was swirling
Through the mazes of my mind

Watch my gold,
It can be never bought or sold
Made up and collected through the years
From emotions and dreams

A noble line I carry on
Exploring the ways I never saw

Longing for a whisper
That would carry me away
Faced my ultimate desire that was swirling
Through the mazes of my mind

(Solo: Aydan)
(Melody: Jarpen / Regality: both)

Reunifying with air and soil I am part of
Distant yet so close!

Longing for a whisper
That would carry me away
Faced my ultimate desire that was swirling
Through the mazes of my mind
If you were given chance to fly would you
Retain your tears of joy
Pushed as far as any wind will go,
A fiery stride to the sun

Clearing my path from anything
That leads me to a fall
On the brink of loneliness, I faced
The illusion of leaving from the flock
On this one way trail to unfolding new

Follow me into a solo get in the flow
And you can picture like a photo
Music mixed mellow maintains to make
Melodies for MC's motivates the breaks
I'm everlastin, I can go on for days and days
With rhyme displays that engrave deep as X-rays
I can take a phrase that's rarely heard,
FLIP IT - now it's a daily word
I can get iller than 'Nam, a killin' bomb
But no alarm - Rakim will remain calm
Self-esteem make me super superb and supreme
But for a microphone still I fiend
This was a tape I wasn't supposed to break
I was supposed to wait, but let's motivate
I want to see who can keep followin and swallowin
Takin' the making, bitin it and borrowin
Brothers tried and others died to get the formula
But I'ma let ya sweat - you still ain't warm
You a step away from frozen, stiff as if ya posin
Dig into my brain as the rhyme gets chosen
So follow me and were ya thinkin' you were first?
Let's travel at magnificent speeds around the Universe
What could ya say as the Earth gets further and further away
Planets are small as balls of clay
Astray into the Milky Way - world's outasight
Far as the eye can see - not even a satellite
Now stop and turn around and look
As ya stare in the darkness, ya knowledge is took!
So keep starin' soon ya suddenly see a star
You better follow it 'cause it's the R
This is a lesson if ya guessin and if ya borrowin
Hurry hurry step right up and keep followin
The Leader

Verse Two:

This is a lifetime mission, vision of prison
Aight listen
In this journey you're the journal I'm the journalist
Am I Eternal? Or an eternalist?
I'm about to flow long as I can possibly go
Keep ya movin cause the crowd said so
Dance - cuts rip ya pants
Eric B on the blades, bleedin to death - call the ambulance
Pull out my weapon and start to squeeze
A magnum as a microphone murderin' MC's
Let's quote a rhyme from a record I wrote
(Follow the leader) Yeah - dope
Cause every time I stop it seems ya stuck
Soon as ya try to step off ya self-destruct
I came to overcome before I'm gone
By showin and provin and lettin knowledge be born
Then after that I'll live forever - you disagree?
You say never? Then follow me!
From century to century you'll remember me
In history - not a mystery or a memory
God by nature, mind raised in Asia
Since you was tricked, I have to raise ya
From the cradle to the grave,
But remember - You're not a slave
'Cause we was put here to be much more than that
But we couldn't see it because our mind was trapped
But I'm here to break away the chains, take away the pains
Remake the brains, reveal my name
I guess nobody told you a little knowledge is dangerous
It can't be mixed, diluted; it can't be changed or switched
Here's a lesson if ya guessing and borrowing
Hurry hurry, step right up and keep following
The leader

Verse Three:

A furified freestyle, lyrics of fury
My third eye makes me shine like jewelry
You're just a rent-a-rapper, your rhymes are minute-maid
I'll be here when it fade to watch you flip like a renegade
I can't wait to break and eliminate
On every traitor or snake - so stay awake
And follow and follow, because the tempo's a trail
The stage is a cage, the mic is a third rail
I'm Rakim the Fiend of a Microphone
I'm not HIM, so leave my mic alone
Soon as the beat is felt, I'm ready to go
So fasten your seatbelt, 'cause I'm about to flow
No need to speed slow down to let the leader lead
Word to daddy, indeed!
The R's a rollin' stone, so I'm rollin'
Directions is told, then the rhymes are stolen
Stop buggin', a brother said, dig em, I never dug 'em
He couldn't follow the leader long enough so I drug 'em
Into danger zone, he should arrange his own
Face it, it's basic, erase it, change ya tone
There's one R in the alphabet
It's a one-letter word and it's about to get
More complex from one rhyme to the next
Eric B be easy on the flex
I've been from state to state, followers tailgate
Keep comin' but you came too late, but I'll wait
So back up, regroup, get a grip, come equipped
You're the next contestant - clap ya hands, you won a trip!
The price is right - don't make a deal too soon
How many notes could you name this tune?
Follow the Leader is the title, theme, task
Now ya know, you don't have to ask
Rap is Rhythm And Poetry, cuts create sound effects
You might catch up if you follow the records E. wrecks
Until then keep eatin and swallowin
You better take a deep breath and keep followin
The leader."

Raping the land and water and the air
Tomorrow may be too late?
Now's the time that you must be aware
Nature's disappearing
Polluted death is coming, do you care?

Garbage going nowhere
Soon the dumps will spread to your front door
Lakes and rivers stagnant
Nothing lives or grows like years before
Nature's disappearing
The world you take for granted ... soon no more

Read about pollution
Make manufacturers uncomfortable
Boycott at the market
Containers that are non-returnable
Aluminum, glass or plastic
Eternal waste that's not destructible

We're of a generation
That may live out our natural time
But as for all our children?
Born to suffocate in human slime
Nature's disappearing
And we are guilty of this massive crime"

Wondering what each present will hold
Lying in their beds and impatient

Would gather for this one night
It used to be that special feeling
Shared together knowing
Christmas was here
One night a year

Call me sentimental, don't mind if you do

Waiting for it to come back to me

I want to live near the sea
Crab claws and bottles of rum
That's what I'll have
Staring at the seashell
Waiting for it to embrace me

I put my soul in what I do
Last night I drew a funny man
With dog eyes and a hanging tongue
It goes way bad
I never like that sad look
From someone who wants to be loved by you

I'm very good with plants
When my friends are away
They let me keep the soil moist
On the seventh day I rest
For a minute or two
Then back on my feet to call for you

You've got cucumbers on your eyes
Too much time spent on nothing
Waiting for a moment to arise
The face in the ceiling
And arms too long
I'm waiting for him to catch me

Waiting for it to embrace me oh"

With cotton candy in your one hand and your other hadn in mine
It seems just like yesterday, letter jackets and football games girl
We've come a long way through the years had our fair share of heartache and tears

We've had our ups and downs and turn arounds but our love was stronger than any fight
Even when we lost control we never let go we kept on hangin' on for dear life
I know no matter the size of the mountain you and me will be side by side
Baby ain't life and love one big rollercoaster ride

Back in the day we were cool and crazy like two outlaws on the run
Now making love means making babies and I swear we're having twice the fun
It's been no walk in the park but then again that's not our style
It wouldn't be too entertaining without a little drama every once in awhile

What they were
They are haloed in anger, bitter
And hurt
And it's not so you'd notice but
It's a sinister thing
Like the wheels of ambition at
The christening

So I went out walking on the
Streets of the dead
With a chip on my shoulder
And a voice in my head
It said you have been brought here
Though you don't know what for

Well the mystery train is coming
Right to your door

And I hear you calling, you
Don't have to call so loud
I see you falling and you don't
Have to walk so proud
You can run all night but we
Can take you where
You can cry like an angel

There were high school night dances
When we played stump the band
We were raising each other
In a strange land
There were hard pills to swallow
But we drank 'em all down
Oh the nights were too short then
And now they're a little too long

I hear you calling and you
Don't have to call so loud
I see you falling and you don't
Have to walk so proud
You can run all night but we
Can take you where
You can shout out in anger
You can laugh like a fool
You can cry like an angel

So look homeward baby
Keep your eyes on the sky
They will never forgive you
So don't ask them to try
This is your party, I know
It's not your ideal
May we all find salvation
In professions that heal

I hear you calling, you
Don't have to call so loud
I see you falling and you don't
Have to walk so proud
You can run all night but we
Can take you where
You can shout out an answer
You can laugh like a fool

You can call up to heaven
We'll be listening to you
You can sing hallelujah
You can fly like a bird
You can cry like angel
When there are no words"

Der Lorbeerkranz, ein neuer Tanz
Schwingt Rhythmus in die H√ºften der Stadt

Fragt nicht nach neuen, alten Werten
Seht wei√ües Licht, seht nur Gef√ºhl
Die Nacht geh√∂rt uns bis zum Morgen
Wir spielen jedes Spiel

Lass diese Reise niemals enden
Das Tun kommt aus dem Sein allein
Allein aus Dimensionen, die
Illusionen und Sensationen lohnen

Sie lieben ihre Schwesternliebe lieber als den Rest der Welt
Frag junge R√∂mer - kennt ihr die Sonne noch?
Sie kennt die Sorgen
Junge R√∂mer - die Nacht ist jung wie ihr
Vergesst das Morgen

Un ballo nuovo porta ritmo nei fiancho della citt'
Ci vendiamo, trovimo, chiediamo che cosa si fa
Ma non cercate die volori, e magari sensation
La notte e'nostra fin al mattino abbiamo illusion
No E'la fine del viaggino, ce' sempre un domani e
Ci sono dimensioni, con illusioni e sensazioni

Give me more ...

And that price is still to pay

And my time got shorter and you was havin' a daughter
Had to stop hopscotch, get off Iran

If I could rewind the time to when it was all good

Thought he'd never get caught tryin' to play on whores
I cried as my keys was scrapin the car doors
From the trunk, to the hood, by the wheel and the floor
Exposed my vulnerable side, had me open wide
Said you forever keep it real, but you lied
Was the first to feel inside, the Ill Na Na
Had me thirst when you whispered to me, ""How it feel mama?""
Yeah, but don't hurt it, I like the way you work it
No Diggity, don't stop get busy
Blew up your pager, checked your clothes
Duked your house keys, stole your beeper code
What happened to the Mo's and the occasional roses
Massages and the bubble baths, rubbin my toes as
I realize you was just misleadin me
I shoulda known, you left your last chick to be with me

Mommy dearest tried to prepare us for a lot ahead
You never heard, preferred to smoke your lye instead
On the one to one combo told me you'd die for bread
That's why I spend these nights, cryin in the bed
You had the deep dish six, your rep was widespread
I tried to intervene you said it was over my head
Said I'd never understand the plight of a black man
Right, but I'm tryin' to keep you in my life
V.I.A. satellite, talkin' them burn outs
Soon you had me whylin and you turned me out
Taught me bout how to win, the code of the streets
Luxuries and wealth untold it was sweet
And one night you asleep after work was chopped up
Felt somethin' strange in my veins, I popped up
One foot in the house shoot flew to the horn
Got the cell operator, I knew you was gone"

Pretending and inventing
Just to hide your shame

Empty friends and places
All magnify your fears

It feels to be alone
I will take your burden
If you'll let Me love you
Wrap My arms around you
Give your heart a home

It hurts to watch you struggle
And try so hard to win
But trade your precious birth rite
For candy coated sin
Wasting priceless moments
Restless and confused
Building up defenses
For fear that you'll be used

And dry the tears you've cried

Never turn away
Keep you through the darkness
Lead you through the day

This is why knowledge of self is essential
'Cause if you don't have it, you may simply go mental
See, life is not a thing to be toyed wit
'Cause every second, another dream is destroyed wit

If that's the way things have got to be
Remember this - it's the love that I gave you
You'll try to say that you cared for me.

Oh - if you leave me don't ever regret it
'Cause there's no playing with destiny
Oh - you say enough but you've got to have meant it down deep.

Because you feel so deep
Oh yes you feel so deep
There's nothing left for me
Because you feel so deep.

Well if you go there is no way to argue
If that's the way that your mind is made
I feel the sadness of knowing I failed you
But that won't change a decision made.

Oh if you go just look back on what I told you
That if you're gone there's no turning back
Oh you say enough it's because love is cold so deep"

In the winston lips of September, how we met

Decked out like aces, we'd beat anybody's bet

'Cause we was Coolsville... 'cause we was Coolsville

Well you stick it here;
You stick it over there;
But it never fits

And now a hungry night you want more and more
And you chip in your little kiss.

And you're chippyin' your little kiss

Well, I jumped all his jokers,
But he trumped all my tricks

And I swear to God I thought this one was smart enough to
Stick it into Coolsville... yeah stick it into Coolsville...

So now it's J and B, and me, and that sounds close,
But it ain't the same (well, that's okay)
Hot City don't hurt that much but everything feels the same
Well the real thing come and the real thing go...
Well the real thing is back in town...
Ask me if you wanna know The way to Coolsville...

Like a stream overflowing
Unpredictable
A new confidence like a new king
Like a breeze levitating
To raise a sunken soul
And to the surface shines like a new pin

What junkie says is not what junkie do
But it's all for you
And the tricks he turns will always shine right through
But it's all for you

Like a dream synchronising
With the one I missed the most
A concentrated love from a new queen
Like a wave stabilising
I walk a tighter rope
And my new victim shines like a new pin

The tactless sentiments are a new pain

Check this out
Hey, I knew this nigga named Johnnie Walker
A nightstalker, a big shit-talker
Even though he liked a lot of vodka (say what?)
He was from Tennessee, sprung off Hennessey
Makin' enemies fast - in L.A.N. they didn't play (what?)
He got into a Tanque/tangle with +Ray+, he had on too much gray
Ray had a Strawberry sister named Daquiri
Johnnie politely her ass behind the back three
Now, all four uncles E&amp;J wanna tossi
Martini and Rossi had to get the niggaz off me
He got jacked for his Dana's, in other words
(Give it up nigga, give it up!)
He caught the Nighttrain and blasted his Thunderbird
With the pistol, him and Cisco, couldn't stand him
'Cause he caught him lickin' Brandy off his sister named Kandi
At this point he had more bad luck than a trash truck
He lost his girl, Remi spent his last buck up
Remi caught him shootin game at Elayne, so now
Flowers and champagne don't mean a damn thang
Remi ended up runnin' off with Martin
He was wanted for arson for startin fires in Carson
So Johnnie hired a gun named Rum, and paid him
151 and the job got done
With a thirty-eight straight to the face
He caught him in a six-pack and got they ass back
Up close he made 'em post and broke all their glasses
(?) And Rum threatened their families with matches
He felt he needed more men just like Gin
So he packed his strap and started claimin Silver Satin
From then on in, anybody caught bailin
Down Seagram's 7 was bound to get sweated
Except Bartyles and James, 'cause they was cool
He knew 'em from school when they didn't bang and made moves
Turns out, he never reached the top
They found his ass at the beach ""on tha rox""

In a crowd of teenagers coming out of the zoo
She stumbled, started to slip and fall
Teeter-tottered on the top of patent leather shoes
I happened to catch her and said
""Maybe these ruby shoes are a little cumbersome for you.""
Maybe for you, now

But not as shaky as I must have seemed
Talking junk through her giggle little teenage dream
And on the phone I could not compete
My dumb luck fake confidence was getting weak
And for a sec', I thought I sounded sweet
But sure enough in a gruff, faint voice
I heard myself speak

I could stay a while
But sooner or later, I'll break your smile
And I can tell a joke
But one of these days, I'm bound to choke

And we could share a kiss
But I feel like I can't go through with this
And I bet we could build a home
But I know the right thing for me to do
Is to leave you alone
Leave you alone, now

I'm beginning to like you
So you probably won't get what I'm going to do
I'm walkin' away from you
It probably don't make much sense to you
But I'm trying to save you
From all of the things that I'll probably say or do
I'll probably do, now

And I bet we could build a home
But I know the right thing for me to do

Leave you alone, now

You'll probably call me a fool
And say I'm doing exactly what a coward would do
And I'm beginning to like you
It's a shame, what a lame way to live, but what can I do?
I hope you appreciate what I do

You know I gotta represent the city doe
A nigga fin' to shoot a new video
So I'm fin' to take a trip out to Cali yo
Took a flight, ten of us in a group
Hit the West coast, now I'm fuckin' with Snoop
Told a few hoes to come up to the shoot
And she was lookin' so cold pullin up in the Coupe
Pretty skin tone, a nigga got y'all
Soon as I took a look at them big brown eyes
Fat ass, my dick got hard
Soon as I took a look at the big brown thighs
Too sassy, bet you doin' nasty
And I can tell it when I'm lookin' at the way you walk
Thick lips, ready for suckin
And a nigga wanna fuck you when I listen to the way you talk
I'ma do it like this when I drop at you
Let you know that I'm the Twist' when I pop at you
Comin' at you in the Mission Impossible
Let's go to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles
Then as soon as we leave we gon' have to go and get naughty
Then when I come back (chirrp) (hello?) Whassup shawty?

It's Snoop Dogg, you know you gotta get wit
The game that I spit, the way that I rip
Let's, go and do, this
Ride, ride, slip and slide
I'm comin' by, let a nigga inside
What we gon' do, it's all upon you
What I say, what it do?
Do - no not you, you know I got to
And if you got me, then I got you


I'm a player, youse a player
We some players, so we should play a
Game, do yo' thang
Ain't it mayne, turn the lights off
Hit the right spot (ooh)
Make me feel how I wanna feel
But it can't happen if you ain't real
Don't, you, play with me
Come and spend, the day with me
Everything is everything
Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the dopest of 'em all
Gots to be Big Snoop Dogg
So pick up the phone and answer my call

(Snoop Dogg)
How, long, has it been
Since you had that thang up in
They say Dogg you walk it too much
And you may think I'm talkin' too much
But then again I reminisce
I miss that hug, I miss that kiss
I miss that love
Really 'cause, I miss that bitch

(Twista)
And I love it when you hit that switch
Shorty tell me how you get that thick
Where the fuck did you get that fit
Come and fire the 'dro up let me hit that shit
That's right - had a nigga feelin' so good
That when I had went home
I was thinkin' 'bout you so hard
That I couldn't help but to pick up the phone

And I just had to call ya
I'm lovin' how you look and how you smell
And you got a ass fat as hell
I just had to call ya
Girl I'm lovin' what you do to me
You break me off and then put me to sleep
I just had to call ya
I got a couple things that we can do
Just let me know if I can come through
I just had to call ya

And a light that guides my way
So, I'll keep my eyes on Jesus
Until the Judgment Day

There's a road that lies before me
And the path I choose to take
Is the one that leads to mercy
And the way that leads to grace

I will call upon His name
With a fervor like a flame
I will fall to my knees
With my eyes looking up
To the cross that bears His name
To the one who stays the same
To the cross that bears
The name of the Son

Lord, I know the sin within me
It could weigh me down with shame
Still, You're waiting to forgive me
As I call upon Your name
I will call upon Your name

Oh, Lord
Oh, Lord
Sweet Lord
I call Your name

I will call upon His name
With a fervor like a flame
I will fall on my knees

Than push my limbs out towards you right there 
My heart is bursting in your perfect eyes 
As blue as oceans and as pure as skies 

I struggle for the words and then give up 
My head's up with the birds on the T hut 
A little peace of mind that I know better 
Than the plain disgrace of all my letters 

But after that the floodgates opened up 
And I fell in love with everyone I saw 
Please take your time, I'm not in any rush 
And it's in everything I ever write 

It's not as if I need the extra weight 
Confused enough by life, so thanks a lot 
Lonely written words for company 
Just raise the roof this once and follow me

To see the earth through painted eyes?
To look through panes of shaded glass
See the stains of winter's grass?

So make your way on down to the sea

Can you now return to from where you came?
Try to burn your changing name
Or with silver spoons and colored light
Will you worship moons in winter's night?

With a sense of danger and demise
The world will numb everything, hope and fear
A negative discipline, a vacuum

What evil force dragged them down?
What demon singled them out?
What evil took them away?
Allowing only two choices

So tell me
Was there a secret never shared with others?
Was there a hidden trauma?
What made the bonds break?
What caused the mistakes?
Why was the criminal life so desired?

Born with our senses keen, hope and fear
With a sense of danger and demise
The world will numb everything, hope and fear
A negative discipline, a vacuum

From afar, bleak reports trickle in
But the world has spread apart, the world has spread apart
All the promise that was held now is wasted
The soul is delicate, the walls have crippled it
From afar, troubled lives lose their purpose
The world has given up, the world has given up
The world has finally forsaken its sons

""I'm not sure anymore...""

And now, amidst the waves and the cloudless skies
That'd blanket the year before
I watch my life wash ashore

Have you ever been a part of something 
That you thought would never end
And then of course it did?
Have you ever felt the weight inside you
Pulling away inside your skin
And then something had to give?

Now the lines are drawn
Is this feeling gone?
The best parts of this have come and gone
And now there is all this is
With the reasons clear
We'll spend another year
Without direction, full of fear
But now things will be different

There's nothing simple when it comes to you and I
There's always something in this everchanging life
And there probably always will
Now that time is getting harder to come by
The same arguments are always on our mind
We've killed this slowly fading light

Now the lines are drawn
Is this feeling gone?
The best parts of this have come and gone
And now there is all this is
With the reasons clear
We'll spend another year
Without direction, full of fear
But now things will be different

And now something 
Has kept me here too long
And you can't leave me 
If i'm already gone

Well now something (hey) 
Has kept me here too long
And you can't leave me (hey)
If i'm already gone

Now let's say that something (hey) 
Has kept me here too long
And you can't leave me (hey)

Now that we
Make the same mistakes, we're always hanging on
Break those promises we're always leaning on

Speak the words
That keep me coming back to you

When I rock the mic you got to like the way I operate
I make miracles happen just from rappin'
I'm so lyrically potent and I'm flowin' and explodin'

On the scene mean I got the potential
To make you go then chill
I got the credentials that is of which I chose
To make a rhyme and chill then you know

I will fulfill to make a couple of mill
As I build a guild for all the rappers and skills
And kill the weak rappers and no thrills
Hang 'em an ephigy if he's a sucker

Hang 'em to the left of me 'cause my right hand man
Is my mic stand and the microphone that I own
And my game plan is keeping at a steady pace
Ain't no need for a rush it ain't no race

I'ma hit the top just when I wanna
And it's a matter of time and I'm gonna
'Cause I know when to go 'head enter
The classic Moe Dee rap that sent ya

Runnin' around holdin' ya head
Askin' ya homeboy yo man
You hear what he said another funky rhythm
Look at ya man and give him a high five

'Cause I'm live runnin' around with him
Telling everybody hanging out on the block
It's time to wake up and check the clock
Punch it I go to work, I go to work
I go to work like an architect

I build a rhyme some times it climbs so erect
Skyscrapers look like atoms
Cars electrons rollin' in patterns
Writing out word after word

With each letter it becomes visibly better
'Cause my foundation built a nation of rappers
And after I came off vacation I came to roam the land I own
And stand alone on the microphone daddy's home

Open the door playtime is over
Time to go to work and show the
Suckers in the place who run their face
The base and a taste of who's the ace

Start the race I'm coming in first
With each verse I build a curse
So rappers can't capture Moe Dee's rapture
After I got ya I have to slap ya

Senseless with endless rhymes don't pretend this
Is anything short of stupendous
And when this rhyme is done your mind will become
So trapped in the rap you'll lust on another one
You gotta wait it takes time

I don't write I build a rhyme
I draw plans draft the diagrams
An architect in effect and it slams
And if it's weak when I'm done
Renovate and build another one

I go to work I go to work I go to work like a boxer
Train the brain and aim to out fox ya
Like a punch my rhyme knocks ya
Some times it rocks ya

So hard it stops ya dead in your tracks
So power packed before you can react
You're flat on your back down for the count
Get up and dismount 'cause I'm coming
With an endless amount of words in a hurry like a flurry

A collage to camouflage the power punch but don't worry
Knowledge is an antidote I got hand of smoke
Writing at the speed of light with insight
I wrote rhymes at a level so you can't relate unless you're intelligent

So stay awake sleepwalkers slick talkers
This time a native New Yorker's
Riding a crescendo wave to save the mental
State of the fan so he can understand my pencil

Rhymes in its highest form I'm a drop it on ya like a bomb
When it explodes I'll blow up a few casualties but so what
If you're slow you blow you know you go I flow
I throw all pro I go to work I go to work To say rap is not work

Is ludicrous whoever said it must be new to this
When you hear me you'll compare me to a prophet for profit not merely
Putting words together for recreation each rhyme's a dissertation
You wanna know my occupation, I get paid to rock the nation
I go to work, I go to work, I go to work"

Kiss your eyes and finish your life. Kiss your eyes. Finish your life

Hey man, I'm making a plan!

And this time I'm ready to roll!

My ship's comin' in 
And this time I'm ready to roll!

In the beat of a drum, you could dance to the sun
And the world is alive, let tomorrow decide
In the morning time

I believe in the age of innovation
I believe there's a cure for the disease
And now we gotta spread it around

And trough the empty halls,
I could hear the sound,
Echoing a call,
Of a love so strong,
That gently slipped away,
Now there's no one left to hold today,
You know what they say

When your heart is bleeding it'll heel in time,
But what if I myself am guilty of the crime,
'Cause I see

I didn't realize I had it all,
Instead I chose to take a fall,
Now it's all the same,
And I've me to blame
Now I'm left alone with my shame,
Left with all my shame

Painful whispers,
Shouting in my head,
Things that were bright yellow,
Are now black instead

I had a secret meeting with a strange desire,
I couldn't get enough it only took me higher,
Now I see

I didn't realize they had it all,
Instead I chose to take a fall,
Now it's all the same,
And I've me to blame,
Now I'm left alone with my shame

The picture of us on the window seal,
It's not replaced with dust,
And your fingerprints are gone,
And now loneliness is a friend of mine

I didn't realize they had it all,
Instead I chose to take a fall,
Now it's all the same,
And I've me to blame

I didn't realize they had it all,
Instead I chose to take a fall,
Now it's all the same,

Some poeple change for the better, some poeple change for the worse
But umm, some people need to make that change

Why would I change?
I ain't never slide down a bad pole
Even though I'm certified over plaques sold
They say I'm different 'cause I ride in a plat. Rolls
But every time, we gotta ride don't this cat roll?
I never snitch and go and hide in a rat hole
And I ain't givin' you nothing besides what this gat hold
No pride, I ain't that old
Cut off a few, but kept a few girls I decide like I'm Matt Knowles
It probably don't seem like a struggle
But I used to dream that this thug'll balance beams just to smuggle
It's funny same girls that didn't seem like they'd love you
Is beggin' for your autographs ands screamin' to hug you
It's crazy, same dudes that seem like they thug you
Is prayin' on your downfall, schemin' to mug you
And people that didn't give a fuck, is dreamin' to bug you
And goin' through' extreme's just to plug you, who really changed?

I ain't stepped outside of Superman's phone booth
To remind where I'm from, I look at my own tooth
I'm speaking the known truth
I ain't been living the same since I moved under the Sylvia Rhone's roof
Why would I feel like I'm a stranga
And why should I feel like I'm in danga
And I grind until I'm right
Whether it's on the streets or online tryna climb sites
I ain't blind from the limelight
I had my mind and my rhymes tight and sign when the time's right
People shouldn't be hateful, they should be grateful
But fuck it, I guess I gotta keep my .38 full
I'm playing the game like I'm supposed
Staying the same like I'm supposed

If you don't ride for me, then I won't ride for you
This game ain't change me, don't let it change you

Why would I change when I get green like the Incredible Hulk?
I've chilled with the richest people to the ghetto-est folks
Known a few dime moves and met a few Locs
Made a few comments and said a few jokes
But it's gettin' me sick, someone prescribe me some medicine
Before the fame, the vibe was way better then
Some have even became rivals instead of friends
Only two become liable for settlements
I grew up watchin the Bed-Stuy with some veterans
Now they hate to see a nigga drivin' the better Benz
That's why the clubs be, deprivin' to let us in
They know the family bring knives and barettas in
I'm thankful for being allowed, fans for being the crowd
How could my head be in the clouds?
It's strange, what the fame'll do
But you know what? The only one who seen the change from the fame is you

This game ain't change me, so don't let it change you
If you've been real with me, I'm still real with you
If you got love for me, I still got love for you
If you down for me, then I'm still down for you
If you don't fuck with me, then I don't fuck with you
If you ain't cool with me, then I ain't cool with you
If you won't ride for me, then I won't ride for you

Look me in the eye 
Tell me if you see 
Traces of yourself 
Growing here in me 
Tell me if you find 
Your heart in mine 
I pray you'll see your light 
When you look me in the eye 

Many years have come and gone 
Since I wrote that page 
And somehow with the passing time 
I've let that truth slip away 
Dear Lord remind me 
Each and every day that your 
Holiness, your Godliness 
Is all that will remain 

Look me in the eye 
Tell me if you see 
Traces of yourself 
Growing here in me 
Tell me if you find 
Your heart in mine 
I pray you'll see your light 
When you look me in the eye  

Now I see you 
Much too dimly 
But someday we'll be 
Eye to eye 
When I see you 
I want to hear you say 
That you were proud of my life 
Lord touch my heart 
Center my soul 
Till all I do 
Is for You alone 

Look me in the eye 
Tell me if you see 
Traces of yourself 
Growing here in me 
Tell me if you find 
Your heart in mine 
I pray you'll see your light 
When you look me in the eye"

And time is frozen but somehow flying by
Here with your hand holding mine

It just feels right kissing on a Sunday
I'll hold you tight as if it were the last day
With all my might, I will keep the world away
It just feels right kissing you on a Sunday

Time is racing to the sound of my heart beating
Can the dreaming escape this life
Unfair, maybe, but know that I'm not leaving
Right now, baby, life is kind

Make this moment last for a lifetime
Don't let it slip away

You were seventeen
You were half my age
The youth I'd never seen
Unlikely people meeting in a dream
Heaven only knows the way it should have been 

Here today my tomorrow
Where you lead I will follow
All that kissing
No passion missing
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye 
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye 
Come live with me

Dinner parties followed
And all my age implies
My friends began to talk
I began to realise
If half the things they say
Are quarter true of me
Then how can I eclipse the youth
You gave to set me free 

There was something in your smile
That was hard to reconcile
The time had come to testify to reason
Though years will not erase
Remembrance of those days
At least there's no submission to hearts treason 

Here today my tomorrow
No more shame only sorrow
All that kissing
There's something missing
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye 
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye 
Come live with me

Now there's nothing left to cry for
And there's nowhere left to go
Just another hopeless fight
But how were we to know
The strong are sometimes wrong
But the weak are never free
The choice we made we can't evade
Don't try to follow me 

Here today my tomorrow
No more pain only sorrow
All that kissing
There's something missing
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye
Come live with me

Way up on the summer range.
Found a place to make my bed
As the evening shadows spread
Beyond the campfire light,
In the stillness of night,
Came the call of a coyote choir,
And the song
Of the wind in the wire.

As it strummed the rusted strings,
It sang of long-forgotten things.
Many moons and many suns
Of the real Americans.
When the arrow and the bow
Stalked the range
Of the buffalo,
And the call of the coyote choir
Knew no song
Of the wind in the wire.

As the ghostly balladeer
Hypnotized me, I could hear
Bugle calls, and battle cries.
Broken promises and lies.
The spirits of the plain
Still sing their sad refrain
In the call of the coyote choir
And the song
Of the wind in the wire."

And soon the Firebrand he'd secure
Until he met at Glenmalure

They're flashing over the English pale
See all the children of the Gael
Beneath O'Byrne's banners

Would you let a Saxon cock
Crow out upon, an Irish rock?
Fly up and teach him manners

And now for Black Fitzwilliams head
We'll send it over dripping red
To Queen Liza and her ladies

The garden swells with a thousand more wise
Forever flung to celestial dreams
Clawing at the grave of the dead Nazarene

I watch the storm approaching
The darkness calls my name
The trees are growing restless
They feel the season change
Their fruit has putrefied
Forbidden once and bound to die
The thread of life lies severed
On the brink of paradise

Grinning winds of hate unfurled
Towers tall that grip the sun
Talons stretch 'neath her veil
Reclamation, our time has come
Our time has come

Autumn spreads its golden wings
And lays the path for those unseen
A tangled web of evil spun at last
Winter spawn from barren thighs
To readdress, to slay the blind
And throw the reins untethered to the skies

They pray to the full moon rising
Diana moving with such infinite grace
Wrapped alone in a blanket of nightfall
How many secrets can they read by your face?

Will they know of majesty
Of beauty held in dream-dead sleep
And scarlet seas that bleed the frozen shores?
Will their God of bridled love
Assuage our rule from planes above
Or shrink in fear from chaos roused for war?

War!

Wrest askew the nails
That have held you, lurking deep
September prayers are waning
Burn the shrines of fettered sheep
Spearhead the insurrection
Of a world that seeks no end
We are what we are, what we shall be, again
Again

Appear; draped in terror
To the comfort of your kin
Stain the milky sunset red
And let the others

Dancin' instead of sittin'
The rhymes kick
The beats hittin' you
Just like a home run
Slammin' like a slam dunk
Riding the wave that James Brown gave funk
It happened to James, like it happened to me
How you think I feel to see another MC
Gettin' paid, usin' my rap style
And I'm playin' the background meanwhile
I ain't with that
You can forget that
You took my style
I'm takin' it back
I'm come back like ""Return of the Jedi""
Sucker MC's in the place that said I
Could only rock rhymes
Only rock crowds
But never rock records

How ya like me now
How ya like me now

Now brothers are riding me
Like a pony
I'm no phony
I'm the only real micaroni
Playin' the mic like it's supposed to be played
New jacks, you all shoulda stayed out of the business
What is this, amateur night at the Apollo?
Get off this stage, I'm in a rage
I'm like a lion that's been trapped in a cage
I'm the real king, rap is a jungle
I never understood, how could one go
To a party, watch me, stand around and jock me
Become a rapper, then try to rock me
Scheming like a demon, you're screamin' and dreamin'
I'm from the old school, I used to see men
Dies for less, but I'm not living that way
I'll let my mic do the talkin'
And let the music play

Rap is an art
And I'm a Picasso
But of course
Why else would you try so
Hard to paint a picture, and try to get ya
Self in my shoes, but they won't fit ya
I'm bigger and better, forget about deffer
Every time I rocked the mic, I left a
Stain in your brain that will remain
Stuck in the back of your brain till you see me
Again, respect, I come correct
The rhymes I select are nothing short of
Vernacular's pure and I can insure
Life od death with my breath, my voice is a cure
I heal life from the words I spread
I'll make a sick man rock on his death bed
Sucker MC's, I'll make your girl say ""ow""
She's jockin'

How ya like me now
How ya like me now

It irked my nerve
When I heard
A sucker rapper that I know I'll serve
Run around town sayin' he is the best
Is that a test?
I'm not impressed
Get real, you're nothin' but a toy
Don't ya know I'll serve that boy
Just like a waiter
Hit'em with a place of
These fresh rhymes and
Make sure that he
Pays the bill, and leave him standin' still
When he's had enough, hit him with a refil
And for dessert it won't be no ice cream
I'm just gonna splatter and shatter his pipe dream
Make him feel the wrath, beat him and laugh
Then when I finish them, I'm gonna ask him
Who's the bests, and if he don't say Moe Dee
I'll take my whip and make him call himself Toby
Put him on punishment just like a child, then ask

How ya like me now

Whip him good, then I'll make him sweat
Talkin' about battles and never had a battle yet
But if we ever did
How could you beat me
You're so petrified
Even scared to meet me
My word's the law
That's why you don't beef
You're nothing but a punk, track star, and a thief
So I'm puttin' you on punishment
Just like a child
Never touch another mic

How ya like me now
How ya like me now

I could continue
There's more on the menu
But relax 'cause I'm so far in you
You had enough
I know you're overstuffed
If I keep going
You'll be throwin' up
Old rhymes I used to say
Back in the day
When you used to me
To my parties and pay
Nobody's ever gonna rack me
This I vow
So all I wanna say is

Heading South from Caroline
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

I got in trouble, had to roam
I left my gal and my home
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

Just a kid, actin' smart
I went and broke my darling's heart
I guess I was a too young to know

They took me off the Georgia Main
And tied me to a ball and chain
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

All alone I bear this shame
Well, I'm a number, not a name
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

All I do is sit and cry
When that evenin' train goes by
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

I'll be locked here in this cell
'Til my body's just a shell
And my hair turns whiter than snow

I'll never see that gal of mine
'Cause I'm in Georgia, doin' time
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

I heard that lonesome whistle blow
I heard that lonesome whistle blow"

He's got more fun than anybody's had,
Don't got no worry, don't got no dough,
Everybody's wondering 'bout Mexican Joe.
In old Mexico, they call him the Rhumba King,
Leads all the women around on a string,
When they go out, they get a million thrills,
But the lovely senoritas wind up with the bills.

Dancin', romancin',
Always on the go,
Sun shinin' down on Mexican Joe

He makes the night spots all along the bay,
People want to see him when he comes their way,
He spreads so much joy everywhere he goes,
Everyone shouts ""Viva la Mexican Joe.""
He likes to gamble, at poker he's an ace,
He's always lucky with the cards that got a face,
At winning the money, he is sure a whiz,
But when they win they don't collect
'Cause they don't know where he is.

Dancin', romancin',
Always on the go,
Sun shinin' down on Mexican Joe

He don't no income tax 'cause he don't got no dough,
Still he gets along just fine, how we'll never know,
He's got everything he wants, a girl, a drink, a song,
If we use his formula, we surely can't go wrong.
His favorite playground is anywhere there's girls,
He's got that somethin' that sets their hearts a-whirl,
It couldn't be his money 'cause he ain't got a peso,
But when he wants a kiss all he's got to do is say so

Dancin', romancin',
Always on the go,
Sun shinin' down on Mexican Joe"

It said your book was overdue
And you'd be by to pay your five cent fine
Within a day or two

Since that day the time drags by
Things just aren't the same
For I don't want your five cent fine
I just want to know your name, you wrote

Miss Clara, would it be to bold of me to call you Clare?
My head is spinning, wonder if I dare
To let you know that I care for you Clara

Miss Clara, you're like the cover of a magazine
You outshine every star I've seen
On the silver screen, gee you're keen

Since I saw you at your desk
At the public library
You stamped my book and I took a look
And now your face is all I see

I wish I could get to know ya
So we could plan our honeymoon
We'll trade the Ivy halls for Niagara Falls
When I graduate next June

Oh, Miss Clara, I'd like to see you let down your hair
I'd like to take you with me everywhere
We'd make a nifty pair, sweetie Clare

We can go to my hometown
To meet my mom and dad
He'll try to tell you about the depression years
And all the trouble we had

Mom'll take you to the kitchen
To give you a recipe
And then dad'll take me aside to say
He's glad to have you in the family

Oh, Miss Clara, there's a cozy cottage we could share
Up on a little farm in Delaware
We'd be so happy there, if I could call you Clare

Do be do do
We do be op ee op dee dah
Boo op be op ee dah dee dah

With the blessing of an angel's tear cryin' for y'all
Back to the foundation, takin' you under back where it all started
With a whole new beginnin and a brand new hunger
Starvin to where my skin was suffocatin my ribs
Now we got bitches interior decoratin my crib
Touch the love I got like you holdin' my heart in my hand
And watch my manifesto, shit was all a part of the plan
The fashion that I choose to deal with this shit
Sometimes it's so hard to describe the passion that I feel for this shit
How many struggles I survived just to eat this meal

Testin my strength, that's what the devil's try to weaken me for
C'mon, yes and y'all off to the next step... for sure
Rep and make you wanna accept more

I'm like somethin' that has evolved about a million times
Peep the display with all the new features
The way we really doin' it, these mu'fuckas probably wouldn't believe us
Flipmode Squad by all means, a pledge of allegiance
With the great feelin' of people like the comin' of Jesus
While a lot of other niggaz don't be tellin' you nothin'
That be the same bullshit that's always pushin my buttons
Godly is how we rep this undeniable force
You like a weak preacher, swearin smacked dead on a cross
Kick niggaz like the two back legs of a horse
Chop ya fingers for tryin' to put your hands in the sauce
Sometimes I think that it would be best if you run
And do yourself a favor, cause you got your whole life ahead of you son!
A whole new thang startin for me
Smell so much ass in a spot, the beat got the world fartin for me
When I spit you know I always love to garnish it hard
While you love-it hate-it niggaz trying to tarnish the God
I know some dudes that would love to bring the hatred to y'all
While I continue to bless you with shit that's is sacred to y'all
Even if I had to bend you in place
I always put it down and rep my niggaz from the most genuine place
From my street corner niggaz to my live niggaz everywhere
Too late for turning back, we takin' it there

Was too hot, not to cool down

So goodbye, goodbye, dear, and Amen
Here's hoping we'll meet now and then
It was great fun but it was just one of those
One of those things, just one of those things"

Now, it's been turned to stone
Your stomach feels sick for someone else
But I've broken both my legs falling for you
Drag me on the ground

Powerless I stand
Tarnished blade, cutting through
Pushed into my vein, blood still stains my hands
Sharpening my sense of pain outside

My heart bleeds no more
Now, it's been turned to stone
Your stomach feels sick for someone else
But, I've broken both my legs falling for you
Drag me on the ground

Killing everything off inside
Make sense of everything you tried to hide
Hide from me

My heart bleeds no more
Now, it's been turned to stone
My stomach feels sore from cutting up
But, I ruined all my sanctity for you
Smash me on the ground

I wanted to convince myself there's nothing else to do
I wanted to provide you with proof of what you put me through
I wanted to pretend that it was you
(You're the worst thing that ever happened to me!)

Die!
Killing everything off inside
Make sense of everything you tried to hide
Hide from me

My heart bleeds no more
Now, it's been turned to stone

Darlin' I, I can't explain
Where did we lose our way
Girl it's drivin' me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
If you come back to me
I'll guarantee
That I'll never let you go

Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again, until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

So many nights I dream of you
Holding my pillow tight
I know that I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes
To face reality
Every moment without you
It seems like eternity
I'm begging you, begging you come back to me


Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again, until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

Baby, I'm sorry.
Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done.
Please come back home girl.
I know you put all your trust
In me, I'm sorry I let you down.
Please forgive me girl.

I'm gonna swallow my pride
Say I'm sorry
Stop pointing fingers, the blame is on me
I want a new life
And I want it with you
If you feel the same
Don't ever let it go
You gotta believe, in the spirit of love
It can heal all things
We won't hurt any more
No I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees, begging you please
Come home


Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back

Than a beautiful melody

I think that a song should be sung by a man
Who knows the meaning of the sorrow
And the meaning of true love

I think that a song should be shared among friends
Then when friends are gone the melody and meaning still lingers on
It tells the good times, it tells of the bad
Tells of when we're happy and when we're sad

Everything You touch is a song
You touched my life one day
(And then)
All of my burdens rolled away

(They rolled away)
You wrote a song that even the bees could hum
Everything You touch is a song, oh, everything

Oh, You touched a bird

You went in the jungle and touch a lion

Everything thing in nature sings
Oh, everything, everything You touch is a song

Oh, I'm mighty grateful You came along and touched my life
You touched my life, I didn't think I could last
But along came Jesus and He just
Laid His whole hand on me

You touched my life

She left that night
A suitcase at the door open wide let the cold air come in
And then she asked me for a light

Said she had some old business see an old friend
Or maybe make a new start
But the words of her reason they changed with the season
And the truth burned in my heart

It blew me away and I thought I'd go crazy
'Cause I knew even then I was caught

I'm caught in the rain again
I pray to the Heavens to defend me
I'm caught in the rain
Why's it seem like more rain that they send me?

So I listen to the wind for the answer
Time hangs heavy on my face
I run from the storm that's on it's way
Until I find there is no place

No person, no thing I can run to, no shelter I can gain from the rain
Yes I know this time it's too late, now

'Cause I'm caught in the rain again
And I pray to the Heavens to defend me
I'm caught in the rain
Why's it seem like more rain that they send me? And they send me

And the rain comes down so silently
And time stand's still like it's in front of me
And the years turn to the rain
And this silence kills me

So now in this one horse town bar
I sing in the back room in the December night
Here she comes through the doorway
With a blustering wind that's too cold to forget

She looks like she knew me
The heat shot through me, melted me down
So we sat and talked about the old days
Or any new things that we found

Talked about the days when we were so much younger and innocent
We saw it plain, we were just caught in the rain

We're caught in the rain again
I pray to the Heavens to defend me
Caught in the rain
Why's it seem like more rain that they send me?

I'm out here on my knees
And my love knows I've been trying
Still I'm caught in the rain on these old fool ideas I'm relying
So I guess she gets me the rain again"

Thorns arise with the breeze of cold insanity 
I am alive but yet so dead 

So fucking dead... 

Written in blood over a wasteland of bones 
Reflected upon a frozen horizon 
Sinister and terminal this hope of desolation 
With a whiff of desecration and hate 

So let my burned out mind fall dead to the ground 
And rape my soul with a demoniacal smile 
Stab these thorns deeper into my heart 
And free me from these depressive thoughts

Could anything good come of these feelings that I have?

He loved me more than the grass is green
And even though he had to go I always knew his love was part of me

In a house on an island
There's a tale that must be told
Of our mysterious Misty Mountains
Behind all the songs I wrote
Lives an old man and his shadow
And they're whistling day and night
For whatever, whatever it's worth for
They are whistling for you and I

On a ranch in the wildness
There's a song that must be sung
About a blindfolded angel 
Who never learned the right from wrong
And though I don't know enough English
To describe its troubled mind
But for one thing I am certain 
Is that it sings for you and I

And I tried so hard to figure him out 
But I guess I'm only human
I've been watching him, drawing him
Analyzing him in every way
I could possibly think of

But that does not really help me
You gotta sit back and enjoy
You know Ochrasy raised and betrayed him
Now he sits there all alone
With his soul and his legend
And his epic melodies
They are with us when we're crying
And they are with us when we bleed
Yes, they are with us when we're crying 
And they are with us when we bleed"

Who I'd walk with down to the altar

You'd stand by me

On our honeymoon
I took you on a trip to Malta

And all through the night

Could soon be betrayed
Betrayed like the Rock of Gibraltar"

I've tried so hard my dear to show that you're my every dream.
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme.
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart.
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue.
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do.
In anger, unkind words I said that make the teardrops start.
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

(Cold, cold heart)

There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me.
But now I know your heart is shackled to that memory.
The more I learn to care for you the more we drift apart.
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

Then your love broke through my life
And at last, I saw the light
I was lost, on a long and lonely road
With no place to call my own
Then you made my heart your home
By giving me all or nothing
The best that you could be
Holding the hands of heaven
With a love to set me free
How could I ever doubt you
After all you've pulled me through
Now the least that I can do 
Is give all or nothing for you
Let me go wherever you would send
I allow my will to bend
To the heart of my best friend
Let me show every tired and hungry soul
There's a river that will flow
With a love that won't let go

It's got to be all or nothing
The best that I can be
Holding my hands to heaven
For the bounty in store for me
And how could I ever doubt you
After all you've pulled me through
Now the least that I can do 
Is give all or nothing for you"

Awareness and happiness.

Vibes...

The dance never ends.

But I know you're there.
But I know you're there.

Only you are my happiness.

Memories...

Happiness...

Lovely voices...

In nightfall I'll meet you,
Seeds of desire absolve.
There's no going back.
I'm losing control.

As the morning creeps up,
And I'm looking for the shade.
In your embrace,
My grieving says.

Reach out for me - reach out.
Reach out for me - reach out.

I know you're there... you're there.

Reach out for me - reach out.
Reach out for me - reach out.

I may go with you.

Reach out for me - reach out.
Reach out for me - reach out.

I savour every moment.
I'll savour every moment.
You're precious,

Graceful and strong, No more forlorn

And I don't stand a chance against the monsters that my mind creates.
I don't want to be here, I just want to be numb
Escape the fucking people that believe in this system.
You know they're watching, counting on your mistakes
Waiting for failure, can you carry the weight?
Once had a future, now I'm watching it die
Damn my reflection in the shadows of night.

Listen closely, hear this whole world crumbling
Slowly breaking patiently dissolving
And disgusted with being spoonfed my death-
I can taste it.
Fuck my soul for collecting dust,
I was down and out in the winter months
When I lost old friends that I used to trust
And left promises out in the rain to rust.
Maybe I'm losing control,
Cough up my lungs with the cynical
The older I get, still can't shake the doubt
Still dwell on the shit that drips out your mouth.

So let it be known,
Let the fucking truth be told.
You'll do your best to establish a life on someone else's time.
Your spirit's only borrowed
And all you know,
You miss the days when you could've changed old stupid ways
And all the stars in your eyes have made it hard
To even want to be alive anymore."

When your heart cries loud and no one seems to hear

To regulate their breathing
One more night
The Winter Boys are freezing in their spam tin
The Baltic moon
Along the northern seaboard
And down below
The Winter Boys are waiting for the storm

Bye-bye, empire; empire, bye-bye
Shallow water--channel and tide

And I can trace my history
Down one generation to my home
In one of our submarines
One of our submarines

Red lights flicker, sonar weak
Air valves hissing open
Half her pressure blown away
Flounder in the ocean
See the Winter Boys
Drinking heavy water from a stone

Bye-bye, empire; empire, bye-bye

Tired illusion drown in the night

If the river I cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song

Baby, I thought you and me would stand the test of time
Like we got away with the perfect crime
But we were just a legend in my mind
I guess that I was blind
Remember those nights dancing at the masquerade?
The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
You and I were the renegades, some things never change

It made me so mad 'cause I wanted it bad for us, baby
And now it's so sad that whatever we had, ain't worth saving

If the love that I got for you is gone
And if the river I've cried ain't that long

Talk to me

By my troubled history
Just need a reason why can't I just justify
All the pain and suffering
Yell Out in defiance
Your world's not for me
Confused on a path down a one-way street
Blind from what I can't see
I did it once before like some stupid trend
But I won't be fooled again
Blank stares from a million eyes

Do I fit your policy?

With imaginary words of salvation
The hypocrisy that surrounds my temple
Is assisted by pretenders to the throne

The winds that blow purity
Signify my chosen legacy
I was born to opposition
A contender to creation

In Sorte Diaboli
In Sorte Diaboli
In Sorte Diaboli

For my sins
I will ask no forgiveness
For my sins
They are not to forgive

So never speak of me quietly
Stand by my confession

Against the traitor of the world

Equinox symmetry and the balance is right
Smokin' and drinkin' on a Tuesday night

It's not how you play the game it's how you win it
I cheat and steal and sin and I'm a cynic
For those about to rock we salute you
The dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to

I once was lost but now I'm found
The music washes over and you're one with the sound
Who shall inherit the earth? The meek shall
And yo, I think I'm starting to peak now, Al

Shadrach Mesach Abednego

Only 24 hours in a day
Only 12 notes, well a man can play
Music for all and not just one people
And now we're gonna bust with the Putney Swope sequel

More Adidas sneakers than a plumber got pliers
Got more suits than Jacoby &amp; Meyers
If not for my vices and my bugged out desires
My year would be good just like Goodyear's tires

So I'm out pickin' pockets at the Atlantic Antic
And nobody wants to hear you 'cause your rhymes are damn frantic
I mix business with pleasure way too much
You know, wine and women and song and such

I don't get blue I gotta mean red streak
You don't pay the band your friends and that's weak
Get even like Steven like pulling a Rambo
Well Shadrach Mesach Abednego, you know

Steal from the rich and I'm out robbing banks
Give it to the poor and I always give thanks
Because I got more stories than J.D. got Salinger
I hold the title and you are the challenger

I've got money like Charles Dickens
I got the girlies in the Coupe like the Colonel's got the chicken
Always go out dapper like Harry S. Truman
I'm madder than Mad's Alfred E. Neuman

*Never gonna let them say that I don't love you*

Well, my noggin is hoggin' all kinds of thoughts
Adam Yoggin is Yauch and he's rockin' of course
Smoke the holy chalice got my own religion
Rally round the stage and check the funky dope musicians

Like Jerry Lee Swaggert or Jerry Lee Falwell
You love Mario Andretti 'cause he always drives his car well
Vicious circle of reality since the day you were born
And we love the hot butter on what? The popcorn

Sippin' on wine and mackin'
Rockin' on the stage with all the hands clappin'
Ride the wave of fate it don't ride me, homes
*Being very proud to be an M.C.*

And the man upstairs I hope that he cares
If I had a penny for my thoughts I'd be a millionaire
Amps and crossovers under my rear hood
Because the bass is bumpin' from the back of my Fleetwood

They tell us what to do? Hell no!

And fade away 

For you we drown in tears 
Our sorrow kills our fears 
I'll drink the blood from your poisoned heart to be with you

Lost were we all and still through this we survived

Grateful for everything I have
And I know I should be less downfall
But unfortunately I am just human
I'm in a big hole surrounded by fear

I'm in a deep dark hole
Deep enough for me to disapear
But where should I go?
If Earth's the only place I know
All I know is I don't want this anymore
Living a life without knowing what it is that I'm searching searching for

There are days where I would love to be somebody else
Days where I am fighting myself
There are days where I wish I would be a child again
And sometimes days where I wish they wouldn't last
Days where I wish I would be dead

Step back, stay away from me
Can't you respect that I only need my peace
These days I'm too weak to see
These days are all about me
I don't want to talk things out

Cause there are certain things we don't need to talk about
The silence in between will let you know what I mean
And each time I try to escape
I pray to God not to let me fail
And to take my doubts away

There are days where I would love to be somebody else
Days where I am fighting myself
There are days where I wish I could be a child again
And sometimes days where I wish they wouldn't last
Days where I wish I would be dead..."

Nevermind these things at all, it's nothing.
Couldn't find a way to you, seems that's all I ever do.
Turning up in black and blue, rewarded.

All the static we all left.

Wait till the time has come, figure that's where time comes from.
Leaving all my senses numb, is heaven.
Lifted up the fatal scene, anything could never be.
Anything but play to me, in order.

All the static we all left.

Take it back for them to keep, fallen into something deep.
Not that I had made that leap, anointed.

You know playin' blind man's bluff is a little baby's game
You pick up Little Dynamite I'm gonna pick up Little Gun
And together we're gonna go out tonight and make that highway run
You don't have to call me lieutenant Rosie and I don't want to be your son
The only lover I'm ever gonna need's your soft sweet little girl's tongue
And Rosie you're the one

Dynamite's in the belfry playin' with the bats
Little Gun's downtown in front of Woolworth's tryin' out his attitude on all the cats
Papa's on the corner waitin' for the bus
Mama she's home in the window waitin' up for us
She'll be there in that chair when they wrestle her upstairs 'cause you know we ain't gonna come
I ain't here for business baby, I'm only here for fun
And Rosie you're the one

Rosalita jump a little lighter,
Senorita come sit by my fire
I just want to be your lover ain't no liar,
Rosalita you're my stone desire

Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they're gonna be there
Ah Sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool,
Stay out all night, it's gonna feel all right
So Rosie come out tonight, Oh baby come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
Closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So use it Rosie, that's what it's there for

Rosalita jump a little lighter,
Senorita come sit by my fire
I just want to be your lover ain't no liar,
Rosalita you're my stone desire

Now I know your mama she don't like me 'cause I play in a rock and roll band
And I know your daddy he don't dig me but he never did understand
Your papa lowered the boom he locked you in your room
I'm comin' to lend a hand
I'm comin' to liberate you, confiscate you, I want to be your man
Someday we'll look back on this and it will all seem funny
But now you're sad, your mama's mad
And your papa says he knows that I don't...
(...Have any money)
Oh, your papa says he knows...
(...That I don't have any money)
Oh, so your daddy says he knows that I don't have...
(...Any money)
Well, tell him this is last chance
To get his daughter in a fine romance
Because a record company Rosie just gave me a big advance

And my tires were slashed and I almost crashed but the Lord had mercy
And my machine she's a dud out stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey
Well, hold on tight, stay up all night 'cause Rosie I'm comin' on strong
By the time we meet the morning light I will hold you in my arms
I know a pretty little place in Southern California down San Diego way
There's a little cafe where they play guitars all night and all day
You can hear them in the back room strummin'
So hold tight baby 'cause don't you know daddy's comin'

Rosalita jump a little lighter,
Senorita come sit by my fire
I just want to be your lover ain't no liar,
Rosalita you're my stone desire"

Is trained on our souls.

The gravespin of heroes
Seeds the cloud with dust and blood.

To distance the thunder of truth.

Bullys are cowards naturally,
Spin on one and sink your knee,
Right the wrongs of history.

The strong against the weak
The lines come out and struggle with
The empty voice that speaks, that speaks

Her heart is oh so tired now
Of kindnesses gone by
Like broken glasses in a drain
Gone down but not well spent

The road from Barbary to here
She sold, then stole right back
The vanity, insanity
Her hungry heart forgave

The fading bride's dull beauty glows
Just begging to be seen
Beneath the magic lights that reach
From Barbary to here

Her schoolhouse mind has windows now

And when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say there's no way we're gonna give up (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams

Say, is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe

Does it kill? Does it burn?
Is it painful to learn that it's me that has all the control?
Does it thrill? Does it sting?
When you feel what I bring and you wish that you had me to hold

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say there's no way we're gonna give up (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams

Say, is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?

Brutto bastardo cosa vuoi da me?
Gira alla larga
Cuore di pietra, amore
Cuore di pietra pensi solo a te
Vattene via

Portati dietro I tuoi occhi di vetro fum√©
Viaggia lontano
Verso un mondo lontano da me

Sporco bugiardo, mister grande bugiardo
Solo dio lo sa quanto fa male
Solo promesse, giuda sempre le stesse
Non ne posso pi√π cambia quartiere
Fammi un favore
Non ti voglio vedere mai pi√π
Sali le scale del palazzo poi buttati gi√π

Io resto qui a crescere
E ad innaffiare fiori, a farli fuori
Giardinaggio scellerato per resistere
Senza di te, alla calura estiva
La deriva del mio nuovo grande amore
Per colpa tua.

Non mi conosci, bello
Non mi conosci, non lo hai fatto mai
Avevi fretta
Non hai capito, amico
Non hai capito, solo alibi
E vecchie scuse
Prenditi I soldi e I tuoi nervi ben saldi da spia
Vola lontano
Verso un cosmo lontano, vai via

Io resto qui a crescere
E ad innaffiare I fiori, a farli fuori
Scellerato giardinaggio per resistere
Senza di te, alla calura estiva
La deriva di un appena nato amore
Amore illuso, amore ancora qui a crescere
E ad innaffiare I fiori, a farli fuori
Un coraggio smisurato per combattere
Senza di te questa calura estiva
Depressiva questo deturpato cuore
Per colpa tua"

And I've learned to regret the choices that, that I've made
I want, I want to stay awake for days
Until the sunlight washes over my face

Forgive, forget all of our broken promises
Forgive, forget all of our broken promises
We run, run, run to lose it all

These days, are darker and they draw me in
And I left a trail but no one missed me in, in the end
I'll blend, I'll blend in with the shade I've been
But where, where do I begin, if I want to learn to

Forgive, forget all of our broken promises
Forgive, forget all of our broken promises
We run, run, run to lose it all

I felt a chill in the air and you turned as I said your name
A glance turned to a stare and you hardly knew my face
A blank page, an empty safe, things will never be the same

Forgive, forget all of our broken promises
Forgive, forget all of our broken promises

Forgive, forget all of our broken promises
Forgive, forget all of our broken promises

If I were a circus traveling around
Would I be the high wire or the one falling down?
I need

I am the one
Just who I am and just who you see
A strange contradiction won't let me be
I need

Sunshine and laughter and innocent eyes
Love that stays after the good and the bad times
I need
How I need
To show you the real me is the hardest of all
Should I stay silent or risk the fall?

And what isn't lovely blossoms one day
Turns bitter snow to a sweet summer day
And I need
You need

A brother, a father, and a mother's only son
He was an uncle, a cousin, somebody's best friend
And I'm sure at times a shoulder to lean on
He was somebody's someone.

So I sat there in that chair and helped him understand
How this brave young man gave his life for our land
And although he's someone we'll never know
To you and me he is a hero.

He was somebody's someone, a neighbor, a husband

He was an uncle, a cousin, somebody's best friend

Who kept us safe and out of danger
But now he's just a picture on TV
Somebody's memory.

Since I was little, ain't a god damn thang changed
It's the same ol' same
Bush run shit like Saddam Hussein
I cock and aim, clinically insane
To deal with this bullshit day to day
If I sell some yay or smoke some hay
You bitches wanna throw me up in Pelican's Bay
Call me an animal up in the system
But who's the animal that built this prison?
Who's the animal that invented lower living?

Thank god for Sugarhill

Socked the D.A. before I got gaffled

Don't understand, what's so hard to figure out?

They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

Damn, I can't take the pressure
Pulled the four-four up out the dresser
Grabbed the weight up out the closet
Po-po coming but I'm scared to toss it
Y'all know what happened last time I lost it
Can't tell you niggas what the fuckin' boss did
The game got a nigga exhausted
Gotta go for the big bargain they offered
Twenty years for what?
Breaking these laws that's so corrupt
Taking these halls and fillin' 'em up
Some powder keg shit that's about to erupt
Ay y'all, I'm about to be stuck
Until the year two thousand, what the fuck?
In the hood, don't press your luck
Cause these motherfuckers will set you up, word up

Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

That summer Sunday when you went insane
You said you're going, but instead I came
I'm throwing oranges in an apple cart
The ties that bind are tearing me apart

Jenny says turn off the radio
Jenny says turn off the light
Jenny says turn off the video
You beat yourself up to bring yourself down
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go
When the world keeps coming down on me
I let it go

I've got no reason for the things I say
She turned toward me then she turned away
There's lots of forces in a modern world
They take their toll upon a modern girl
I've got no reason for the things I fear
The things that plague me when I see and hear
I press my finger on an itchy trigger
What once was small right now is so much bigger

Jenny says turn off the radio
Jenny says turn off the light
Jenny says turn off the video
You beat yourself up to bring yourself down
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go
When the world keeps coming down on me
I let it go

I've got no reason for the things I do
The dealer deals and then the deal is screwed
You throw your cards upon the playing table
My name is Cain and I am now unable
I've got no reason for the things I fear
The things that plague me when I see and hear
A dime's a nickel, a nickel's none
I throw myself into the Sunday sun

Jenny says turn off the radio
Jenny says turn off the light
Jenny says turn off the video
You beat yourself up 'cause you love it
Let it go, let it go, let it go

Your mind can wander

They twinkle as the boys
Play rock and roll
They know that they can't dance
At least they know

Has Jesus round her neck
Swinging to the music

Many sailors hearts were filled with sad regret
Looking backward to this Island where they spent such happy hours
Making love to every pretty gal they've met
Well up stopped a little sailor with his bright eyes all aglow
Saying take a look my gal's photograph
Then the sailors gathered round him just to look upon her face
And he said I love my Filipino baby
She's my Filipino baby she's my treasure and my pet
Her teeth are bright and pearly and her hair is black as jet
Her lips are sweet as honey and her heart is true I know
And I love my little Filipino baby

In a little rustic cottage in the Port of Fillippines
Dwells a pretty little maiden all alone
And she's thinking of her true love though he's far off cross the sea
And her heart beats true for him and him alone
Then one day he whispered darling I've come back from Caroline
I've come back to claim the only girl I love
And that night there was a wedding while the ships crew gathered round
And he wed his little Filipino baby
She's my Filipino baby..."

Obey the captain till his dying day

What are they saying in the public bazaar?
We are tired of the tune
You must not relent

At every stroke of the bell in the tower there goes
Another boy from another side
The bulletins that steady come in say those
Familiar words at the top of the hour
The jamming city increases its hum
And those terrible words continue to come
Through brass music of government hear those
Guns tattoo a roll on the drums

No one mentions the neighboring war
No one knows what they're fighting for
We are tired of the tune

And the swallow flies without a thought as long as it is spring
But when spring goes and winter blows my love she will be fain
For all her pride to follow me across the stormy main

The snows they melt the soonest when the winds begin to sing
And the bee that flew when summer shone in winter cannot sting
And I've seen a woman's anger melt between the nicht and morn
So it's surely not a harder thing to melt a woman's scorn

So don't you bid me farewell now no farewell I'll receive

Translation
I give you my waist
and my lips, for when you want to kiss,
I give you my madness
and the few neurons they left me

My discolored shoes, the diary in which I write, I give even my sighs, 
but don't leave anymore

Because you are, my sun, the faith with I live
the strength of my voice
the feet I use to walk.
It is you my love, my desires to live
the goodbye I don't know how to say 
because I will be never able to live without you

If one of these day you would decide to get away from me
I would close every door, so you could never go out
I give you my silence, I give you my nose,
I give you even my bones, but stay here.

Because you are, my sun, the faith with I live
the strength of my voice
the feet I use to walk.
It is you my love, my desires to laugh
the goodbye I don't know how to say 
because I will be never able to live...
....without you"

It's something that I fake as I'm slipping
As I'm falling through the cracks

Faith without actions is a mask
For making the same mistakes
As I'm slipping as I'm falling through the cracks

Somehow I find beauty in our failings
Somehow I find meaning in these lies
Somehow I'm made perfect in this fracture
Your back is begging sweetly for my knives

I'm spilling blood
Glancing down to hide my face
I walk with eyes closed tight
Through monuments of grace

Somehow I find beauty in our failings
Somehow I find meaning in these lies
Somehow I'm made perfect in this fracture
Your back is begging sweetly for my knives

My faith is a front
I'm spilling blood
Glancing down to hide my face
I walk with eyes closed

Through monuments of grace
I'm spilling blood
Glancing down to hide my face
I walk with eyes closed

Through monuments of grace

And how so quickly I break my promises?
Isn't it sweet, isn't it sweet, isn't it sweet, isn't it sweet?"

Just no room for me up on that cloud

Can't find no changes
For better in my luck
Empty are my eyes and my heart
Cold grey days
The nights are so long
My heart is sinking
Bound to a stone

This old world is a bag of tricks
A whole lot of nothin'
Where nothin' ever fits
In all her glory she just don't compare
To one single tear
In your beautiful eyes

Thank you December

Lakes are frozen, trees are bare

Of that I am proud

And I said I am love and how can you resist it?

How can you resist it, now that you kissed it?
How can you resist it, if you go, I know you're gonna miss it?

Poetry in motion but it don't pay no dues
And me, I'm always playing my rhythm and blues
Sitting on the road, Bourbon Street

I got country cousins they got a steely knife
But he doesn't want to settle down for the rest of his life
So I'll just keep it cutting

Living it up when the rent was due
With nothing and no one to live up to

Holding hands and drinking wine
Now I'm not the same girl I left behind with you

Twelve bars behind us
And twelve bars to go
Bottles of beer lined up in a row
One for each hour you didn't show

You and me dying everyday
Getting high just to pass away
But that's not the reason I couldn't stay with you

Now I am sober
Now I'm alone

Letting you go
Letting me go on

Smell of magnolia

And get to the top of a mountain pinnacle

Silent promotion you're feeling within yourself
Just like the ocean, you're crashing against the well
All of the time, you're forgetting about yourself
Looking back after the facts

4932,TRAZOSO128F149739D.h5,N.W.A.,Approach To Danger (Edited),"Eazy:
What you want is an unexpected approach,
That may delay a suspects awareness of your presence,
Until you have a chance to assist the situation you are confronted.

Approach to danger, don't move;
It's hard to predict what will happen next.
(Oh shit, he has a gun!) drop the gun
You could've prevented a tragedy.

Ren:
You can approach, but the danger-light is blinking,
A self-desctruct button is activated when I'm thinking.
This is a tribulation, the weakened judge,
The prophecy was fulfilled 'cause I never budge.
I took up the tools, crucifixion was the extreme,
They're seeing doubles of me, but it wasn't a dream.
One vision was of life, the other was death,
Then I didn't give a fuck if death took your last breath.
So you burn in my pit that I call hell,
Where you got send because your shit don't sell.
My twenty-twenty was blurry from the smoke,
Of the niggaz that I burned and tormented but I didn't choke.
I started doing 'em, I kept on doing 'em,
Do 'em for shoot 'em up till that nigga Ren was booing 'em.
And my presence to the suckers was of a stranger,
But fuck it, they can approach to the danger.

Eazy:
If you can be seen, you can be hit.
If you can be hit, you can be killed.
(He's on the line! Shoot him!)

Dre:
Fatal approach to danger, just to remain a strangeler,
Outrun, the shot of a gun with a ganger.


Murder in the first degree, but it's worse to be,
A dead motherfucker or a nigga in custody.
With everybody thinking of death I kept working,
To be one of the last niggaz left.
So many people looking for hope, they're broke,
Without checking the fingerprints on the motherfuckers' throat.
A heart of steal can reveil the real nigga in me,
So figuring to see the D-E-A-D
Bodies like a nigga's straight walking in a cemetery,
So it's very necesarry to carry ammunition for niggaz wishing,
But they better take caution, before Dre goes off,
And starts killing motherfuckers,
Just in order to change the anger for the real nigga,
When I approach to danger

Approach the motherfucking danger,
Come back to hell and send me some time... (this is it y'all)

Eazy:
Final approach to danger, death, destruction around every corner,
Another dead body and you wanna keep running.
But even the rain turns black,
All you can do is stay alert to try to say out of the search-light.
No prison, nobody makes bail,
Everybody gotta go but see, it ain't no jail.
Think about death, taking your last breath,
Heart beating like a motherfucker like there ain't no time left.
For so many ways to stay up, I gotta get mine,
Even though they wanna make a crime.
Yo, I'm being real, a better or latter in the beginning,
Because it will release the fucking police.
Fuck 'em, I approach to danger,
'Cause I don't give a fuck if somebody gotta get fucked up.
So you might as well kiss your ass goodbye,
Cause in the long run... (we'll all die)"

This disorder in creation of life
Within this endless reign
Vision of lost words rise

Black god to raise hate in veins of the apocalypse
Holocaust of this testament in perceived idea of doom

The left hand of darkness shall bring this final redemption
Conspiracy in the offerings shall ring in horns of requiem

The principle power of deception in tainting the idol's blood
Held in this testimony for the opening of revelation
Unleash the revenge
Bound in the inverted rites

Raise the great wargate in promise of the fallen ones
Adorned in rank through dark incantations, marching forth
Disfigure in abstract reason
Embrace the blind god
Suspension of this balance will break and fall

Be the sword of evil in dissecting of this praise of mercy
Monumental torture within the halls of the cleansed
Perverse in this exploration of a medium absorbed in fear
This lifeless blasphemy will assume the form of wrath

Desecration
An arousing repulsion to this spirited resistance
This desolate becoming

Supremacy
In attaining this oblivion
This force of hell
Great heavens will burn

Bastard in praise with tainted thought
Creation in death
Bound in nails
Great crown of razors
This truth bathed in lies

Fascination of the compelling terror that lies within dark hearts
Warning of the coming horsemen
These revelations will bring sacrifice

Descending
Chained under the earth
The judgment of rebirth
Arise from flame and blood

Revolt of descent
Rebellion in swarms
Dying forgiveness for unanswered prayers."

But I can't take it too much longer

Time stands still, as I lie in place
I try to block out the pitch
In my head that keeps ringing
So I pound and pound on myself
I try to wake myself up
But I can't 'cause I'm not dreaming

It's going down in my dark side
With no release or escape
Doesn't believe in forgiveness
It's an emotional rape

It's going down where no one can see
It's sad, sad sight
No suspense as what will follow
Fractured terror fills my peace
Shocks my senses
Leaves me empty, sad and hollow

Time stands still, as I lie in place
I try to block out the pitch
In my head that keeps ringing
So I pound and pound on myself
I try to wake myself up
But I can't 'cause I'm not dreaming

It's goin' down, it's goin' down
It's goin' down, it's goin' down
It's goin' down, it's goin' down
It's goin' down, it' goin'
It's goin' down

It's going down in my dark side
Shivers and shakes through my soul
Ration surveys the damage
There's nothing left to control

It's going down now, I'm face to face
With the hollowness
That echos in this darkness
How can I fight when I cannot see what to fight
Reluctantly
How can I even stop this

All hell is breaking loose
Now panic rules
As emotions blazed on fire
I'm goin' down down down down down
I'm goin' down
I'm so damn tired

It's goin' down, it's goin' down
It's goin' down, it's goin' down
It's goin' down, it's goin' down
It's goin' down, it' goin'
It's goin' down

It's going down in my dark side

It's goin' down, it's goin' down
It's goin' down, it's goin' down
It's goin' down, it's goin' down
It's goin' down, it' goin'
It's goin' down

It's going down in my dark side"

A world of make believe, a dream for you and I
For one time in my lifetime, I was sure about your love
I held you in my castle in the sky.

Then from another world a stranger came one day
I begged you not to leave, but you left any-way
I saw my castle tumble back to earth and there was I
With mem'ries of my castle in the sky.

The trouble that we're havin', does it mean there's someone new
Or am I just bothered by the thought of losing you
Will someone come and take you, will I lose you by and by
Like I lost you in my castle in the sky.

If we should ever part, the world for me would end
How could I tell my heart, I only lost a friend
Be faithful, don't forsake me, never leave and say goodbye
Like you left me in my castle in the sky."

And I shaved off all my hair 'cause I had the fleas
I'd been sleeping all over
And the Body Shop conditioner was a present from a friend
And the incense used to hide the smell
Of the drug den that I lay in

Read my horoscope in the dailies
And recycle bottles, and know a Red Indian
I could call myself a spirit man
But I was only doing Yoga 'cause I fancied the teacher
And stars 'cause it looked good on paper
And I only went to church 'cause my granny gave me money
When confession was over
And I only knew the Indian 'cause his brother's a dealer
And the bottles had a price on their return
So I could go and play, Oh my my

Why do we try to hide our past
By pulling down houses and build car parks
Windows and mirrors like a two-way glass
This is progress, nothing stands in its path

Yellow bulldozers, the donkey jackets and J.C.B.'s
While hundreds are homeless they're constructing a parking space

Why do they have to knock them down
And leave the site dormant for months on end?
Who has the right to make that choice?
A man whose home has cost forty grand

It's getting late
I'm making my way over to
My favorite place
I gotta get my body moving
Shake the stress away
I wasn't looking for nobody when you looked my way
Possible candidate, yeah
Who knew
That you'd be up in here, looking like you do
You make and staying over here, impossible
Baby, Ima say your aura is incredible
If you don't have to go, don't

Do you know what you started?
I just came here to party
But now we're rockin' on the dance floor, actin' naughty
Your hands around my waist
Just let the music play
We're hand in hand chest to chest and now we're face to face

I wanna take you away
Let's escape into the music, DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it
Please don't stop the, please don't stop the music
I wanna take you away
Let's escape into the music, DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it
Please don't stop the, please don't stop the
Please don't stop the music

Baby are you ready 'cause it's gettin' close
Don't you feel the passion ready to explode?
What goes on between us no - one has to know
This is a private show

Do you know what you started?
I just came here to party
But now we're rockin' on the dance floor, actin' naughty
Your hands around my waist
Just let the music play
We're hand in hand chest to chest and now we're face to face

Even better (let's go)
Set your goals, bless our souls
I'm in trouble (yes, I know), but it feels like heaven

You were like one of those guys
The kind with the wandering eyes
But I said, hey, what the hell Once in my life I'll take a ride
On the wild side.

You were so full of yourself
But, damn, were you cute as well
You liked my legs, I liked your moves
Anyone could tell not hard to deny that

I Did it again now I got it all wrong
But it felt so right, I can't believe it
And all the mistakes that went on for too long
Wish there was a way I could delete them

Second night in a row I'm back in trouble (let's go),
I don't get it (let's go)
Gotta keep it down, 'cause the lobby called
But we ignore them (yes, I know), 'cause it's getting better

When it comes to men it's known
That I end up choosing wrong
'Cause I always trip and fall On the same old rock
And repeat and go back

How blind a girl can be
To miss you hide your ring
Lied about everything I'm so na√Øve
And I should have known that

I Did it again now I got it all wrong
But it felt so right, I can't believe it
And all the mistakes that went on for too long
Wish there was a way I could delete them

It may seem to you that I am in a place
Where I'm losing the direction of my life
But I'm sure that this is nothing but a phase
Right back at ya, 'cause I'll survive

It may seem to you that I am in a place
Where I'm losing the direction of my life
But I'm sure that this is nothing but a phase
Right back at ya 'cause I'll survive

Did it again now I got it all wrong
But it felt so right, I can't believe it
And all the mistakes that went on for too long
Wish there was a way I could delete them

Did it again, love, I got it all wrong"

Yeah, I'll find a way to cure the pain
If I said that you're my friend
And our love would never end
How long before I had your trust again?

I opened up the doors when it was cold outside
Hoping that you'd find your own way in
But how can I protect you
Or try not to neglect you
When you won't take the love I have to give?

I bought me an illusion
And I put it on the wall
I let it fill my head with dreams
And I had to have them all

But oh, the taste is never so sweet
As what you'd believe it is
Well, I guess it never is
It's these prejudiced illusions
That pumps the blood to the heart of the biz

You know I never thought that it could take so long
You know I never knew how to be strong
Yeah, I let you shape me
But I feel as though you raped me
'Cause you climbed inside my world and in my songs

Now I've closed the door to keep the cold outside
Seems somehow I've found the will to live
But how can I forget you
Or try not to reject you
When we both know it takes time to forgive, yeah

Sweetness is a virtue
And you lost your virtue long ago
You know I'd like to hurt you
But my conscience always tells me no

You could sell your body on the street
To anyone whom you might meet
Who'd love to try and get inside
And bust your innocence open wide

'Cause my baby's got a locomotive
My baby's gone off the track
My baby's got a locomotive
Gotta peel the bitch off my back

I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look, I'm not to blame, no

Gonna have some fun with my frustration
Gonna watch the big screen in my head
I'd rather take a detour
'Cause this road ain't getting clearer
Your train of thought has cut me off again

Better tame that boy 'cause he's a wild one
Better tame that boy 'fore he's a man
Sweetheart don't make me laugh
You's getting too big for your pants
And I's think maybe you should cut out while you can

You can use you illusion
Let it take you where it may
We live and learn
And then sometimes it's best to walk away

Me, I'm just here hanging out in my only place to stay
At least for now anyway
I've worked too hard for my illusions
Just to throw them all away

I'm taking time for quiet consolation
In passing by this love that's passed away
I know it's never easy
So why should you believe me
When I've always got so many things to say

Calling off the dogs, a simple choice is made
'Cause playful hearts can sometimes be enraged
You know I tried to wake you
I mean how long could it take you
To open up your eyes and turn the page, hey

Kindness is a treasure
And it's one towards me you've seldom shown
So I'll say it for good measure
To all the ones like you I've known

You know I'd like to shave your head
And all my friends could paint it red
'Cause love to me's a two way street
And all I really want is peace

But my baby's got a locomotive
My baby's gone off the track
My baby's got a locomotive
Gotta peel the bitch off my back

I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look I'm not to blame, no

Affection is a blessing
Can you find it in your sordid heart
I tried to keep this thing together
But the tremor tore my pad apart

Yeah, I know it's hard to face
When all we've worked for's gone to waste
But you're such a stupid woman
And I'm such a stupid man
But love, like time's, got its own plans

'Cause my baby's got a locomotive
My baby's gone off the track
My baby's got a locomotive
Got ta peel the bitch off my back

I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look I'm not to blame
Yeah
If love is blind I guess I'll buy myself a cane

Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange"

I ran up in his spot, with the glock, his jaw dropped
He knew I came for money and the weight I heard he got
I cracked him in the middle of his face with the tome
Tied his ass up and ransacked his home
I had to rep his bitch cause the hoe was stacked
I fucked her from the back, with my gun to her back
I left up out his crib, with dolla and purple hat
But eventually got caught cause ?????????

Don't let me find out that you got that dope
Don't let me find out that you snitchin on folks
Don't let me find out that you tryna get rich
Riddin round' the fuckin' hood 'n' makin' fun of niggaz shit
Don't let me find out, feds tap a nigga phone
Don't let me find out, 'cause if I find out its on
Don't let me find out that niggaz sellin purple drank

Late at night when I'm driving

Casting shivering shadows on the houses through the trees
And the light from a street lamp paints a pattern on my wall
Like the pieces of a puzzle or a child's uneven scrawl

Up a narrow flight of stairs in a narrow little room
As I lie upon my bed in the early evening gloom
Impaled on my wall, my eyes can dimly see
The pattern of my life and the puzzle that is me

From the moment of my birth to the instant of my death
There are patterns I must follow just as I must breathe each breath
Like a rat in a maze, the path before me lies
And the pattern never alters until the rat dies

And the pattern still remains on the wall where darkness fell
And it's fitting that it should for in darkness I must dwell
Like the color of my skin or the day that I grow old
My life is made of patterns that can scarcely be controlled"

A man that only sings the truth
Was just sitting down to talk to me

Said, son, the secret of my overnight success
Was hard work and luck for twenty years and nothing less

If you hang around long enough
If you can have a good time when times are tough
Then maybe, just maybe
You get around to figure it out
What you can do and do without
And you recognize the real stuff
If you hang around long enough

Women rule and men are jerks
And I say, what else is new

And the waitress is hot and the beer is cold
Feeling young and getting old
But I don't know what I'd rather do

The people eye when they say they don't give a damn

Learning to give instead of just take
But when we all start to blend

And passed me the keys, proceeded to roll trees

You say you're gonna get your act together
Gonna take it out on the road
But if I don't get outta here pretty soon
My head's going to explode

Sure I like country music
I like mandolins
But right now I need a telecaster
Through a vibro-lux turned up to ten

Lets go to Memphis in the meantime baby
Memphis in the meantime girl

I need a little shot of that rhythm baby
Mixed up with these country blues
I wanna trade in these ol country boots
For some fine Italian shoes

Forget the mousse and the hairspray sugar
We don't need none of that
Just a little dab'll do ya girl
Underneath a pork pie hat

Until hell freezes over
Maybe you can wait that long
But I don't think Ronnie Milsap's gonna ever
Record this song

Lets go to Memphis in the meantime baby
Memphis in the meantime girl

Lets go to Memphis in the meantime baby
Memphis in the meantime girl

Maybe there's nothin' happenin' there
Maybe there's somethin' in the air
Before our upper lips get stiff
Maybe we need us a big ol whiff

If we could just get off-a that beat little girl
Maybe we could find the groove
At least we can get a decent meal
Down at the Rendez-vous

'Cause one more heartfelt steel guitar chord
Girl, it's gonna do me in
I need to hear some trumpet and saxophone
You know sound as sweet as sin

And after we get good and greasy
Baby we can come back home
Put the cowhorns back on the cadillac
And change the message on the cord-a-phone

But...

Lets go to Memphis in the meantime baby
Memphis in the meantime girl"

Because of you
Any good that I've done
And all that I do
It's all because of you

I give all praises to you Lord
All that I have I owe it to thee
You cleansed me from sin
And set my soul free
To share with others
What you've done for me

Because of the power in your name

And give you glory through eternity"

There's nothing here but a wasteland

And I can still see the graves of the dead

Most of us would rather sit
Than see this wound
That we have created
Let's not last the night

I'm sick and I'm tired of always being the good guy
I'm sick and I'm tired of always being the good guy

Senseless and I'm not sure why
I'm not going to pretend that I know all the answers
Or all of the questions
It's got to be good for something
So we'll chalk this and we'll mount the dead
On the fireplace above right above our guilded heads

I'm sick and I'm tired of always being the good guy
I'm sick and I'm tired of always being the good guy

Like sitting in the back seat (it's all the rage)
And boring me with your body (it's all the rage)

The mark I've borne, a mark of scorn

Consume my love, devour my hate
Only powers my escape
The moon is out, the stars invite

Soon I'll find myself alone
To relax and fade away

Working steady in a good time band
Pickin' every single little lick I could
Just to please the man
Harlan sang the lead for half
And we split up the rest
Hangin' on through the heavy times
And hopin' for the best

And I can't recall the names of all
Them places that we played in
All them squirrely party girls
And pills we used to pop
Hardly ever sleepin' in
Those cheap motels we stayed in
Hopin' we could take it till we'd make it to the top

And them nights, get a little bit brighter
And them bars just a little bit better
And the sweet, just a little bit sweeter
But them blues, well it's still the same old song

Now we're stars and shining on
Them prime time TV shows
Every stranger knows our name
And every little where we go
Findin' out the bottom ain't so different
&gt;From the top
Just a few more friends that you'll be losin'
When you drop

And I've left some of my soul on
Every sweaty sheet that I could sleep on
Gettin' just as close to any body as I could
I don't regret a single bed I've laid my body down on
Ever since the first I had
The worst I had was good
And them nights, get a little bit brighter
And them bars just a little bit better
And the sweet, just a little bit sweeter

And what's you sign
That's why I'll put
My pride to the side
And do whatever it takes
Just to be with you
I'll sweat you
I'll sweat you

I'll be by your side
I'll follow where you lead"

Everybody loves you

But I know that you need
Someone to despise

You don't know what you're after
You fear the highs, breaking ties
You can be a bastard

To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine
You always walked a step behind

So I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strain
A beautiful face without a name
A beautiful smile to hide the pain

Did you ever know that you're my hero
And everything I would like to be 
I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings

It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know I know the truth
I would be nothing without you
I miss everything about you

Did you ever know that you're my hero 
And everything I wish I could be
I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings

Did I ever tell you you're my hero 
You're everything I wish I could be

Baby don't you drive around with Dr. Bernice
She's not a lady doctor at all
She's got hands like a man
With hair on the back
She'll crush you with her embrace

Though the wind may whisper and moan sometimes 
We all need a kind place to live
Though the wind may whisper and howl at your door 
We all need the comfort of friends

Baby don't you drive around with Dr. Bernice
That ain't a real Cadillac
It's a Delta 88 spray painted black 
With fake leather seats from Juarez 

Though the wind may whisper and moan sometimes 
On a hot desert night it is still
Though the world may whisper and howl at your door 
You're not obliged to let them all in

Okay Johnny

Baby don't you drive ride in that faux Cadillac 
If you must please ride in the back
If you sing while you ride you'll be a siren tonight
Spare this poor sailor's life from the rocks

Though the wind may whisper a melody now
We can't find a tune of our own
Though the world may whisper and blow in your face 
And tangle the hair on your head

On a hot desert night we can drive down the road 
And the stars will spell out your name
On a hot desert night with the windows down wide
The sirens will sing me their song

And the ghosts of the sailors who died on the rocks 
Feel not a twitch of regret
Though the wind may tangle the hair on your head
You sing like a siren to me

On a hot desert night, the caravan stops 
At the oasis next to your heart
The soundtrack is played by some aged British queen 
On BBC Radio One

Though the wind my whisper and epic sometimes 
The cast must include Karen Black
Though the symphony strings shifts with the sand
You sing like a siren to me
You sing like a siren to me 
You sing like a siren to me"

Writing a letter to pass time away 
His little granddaughter climbed up on his knee 
Saying won't you please write a letter for me 
Oh what must I say in this letter I pray 
Tell mommy I miss her since she went away 
I coming to see her real soon I hope 
He choked back a big lump that rose in his throat 

He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope 
To God up in heaven you'll get it I hope 
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail 
Her big eyes were shining her little face pale 

She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way 
And when she stepped out never looked either way 
A big auto hit her and sped away fast 
The little girls prayers had been answered at last 

The postman was passing and picked up the note 
Addressed to the Master and these words he spoke 
Straight up into heaven this letter did go 
She's happy up there with her mommy I know"

Been really sweet with my baby 
I gave good times 
Well I've been broken 
Going to bring her back 
Back to my knees 
Knees to my feet 
Feet to my toes 
Well I'm a soldier of grief
Now you pull me down 
You know I need her there
You broke me down 
You know I need her there

Let me sleep on my wrong you know
I was running around 
I won't let you go
You just running around
I get no sleep
I can't get no release

Tells of the women of the sea
They ran from oppression
In the forgotten history

No innocents
No leaders to defend
No god, no government
And it's hard to believe
They were riders on the sea

Women of fortune
Always to be prepared to die
Blood on a knife edge
Flag of the sea lord flying high

A world of action strong and free
Adventure war and loyalty
The mermaid tyrant loved to fight
She ties the noods and pulls it tight

Treacherous island
Somewhere to hide on no man's land
Ships in the harbour
Waiting to hear the battle plan"

I want to be a forester
Run through the moss on high heels
That's what I'll do
Throwing out a boomerang
Waiting for it to come back to me

When I grow up
I want to live near the sea
Crab claws and bottles of rum
That's what I'll have
Staring at the seashell
Waiting for it to embrace me

I put my soul in what I do
Last night I drew a funny man
With dog eyes and a hanging tongue
It goes way bad
I never like that sad look
From someone who wants to be loved by you

I'm very good with plants
When my friends are away
They let me keep the soil moist
On the seventh day I rest
For a minute or two
Then back on my feet to call for you

You've got cucumbers on your eyes
Too much time spent on nothing
Waiting for a moment to arise
The face in the ceiling
And arms too long
I'm waiting for him to catch me

Waiting for it to embrace me oh"

Moving lines, flashing signs
Blinking faster than the minds
Leading people with suggestions
Leaving no unanswered questions
You can live without direction
And it don't have to be perfection

And life is love
In a neon rainbow
A neon rainbow

But in the daytime, everything changes
Nothing remains the same
No one smiles anymore
And no one will open his door until the night time comes

And then the city lights, the pretty lights

Calculate your intuition

Certain factions have to be forbidden or destroyed
Fire has to be sent to the poisoned forest
With the root of fresh trees planted elsewhere

Only then will you obtain a wilderness
That cannot be penetrated, petrified family tree

See what started as a family forest
Got cut to a family tree with the limbs
And the leaves looking' at the world for answers
The world points to the sun and the sun says

The answers in me, so I search through the darkness
Can't find the key so we locked in the land of the lost
Lord, please tomorrow ain't promised to you nor me
So now we choose the roots, so we can plant new trees

Many minds always meet with pens and sheets
Close my eyes, think what next on my rhymes
See this face in ink, I'm havin' visions of wisdom
Dreamin' 'bout my own ending

Am I seein' death as freedom and livin' as prison
My son didn't have a daddy to shape him so
God bless him with a daddy to save him
Yeah I raise him and pay some attention

He talked and he listened to reach him and teach him
Before I'm gone from existence
Teach him 'bout the foes, the hos and all opponents
Those that always talk 'bout love but never showed it

Those who had the chances to stand and always blowed it
Those that set you up by the hour to steal your moment
Pac the word is you ain't there so fuck the rumor
I'll get a pound of that shit from Bermuda

And meet you in Cuba
Fucked up on Larusa no doubt, I know the locale
If they gotta born you, I'm gonna mourne you till I join you

Can't find the key so we locked in the land of the lost
Lord, please tomorrow ain't promised to you nor me
So now we choose the roots, so we can plant new trees

Uh and now I know I got some family
Who missed me from the heart, forever we're apart
Just because I'm nothin' and you abuse me and use me
Now you wanna try to come bruise me

And even though maybe were in there
Farther than it once was I know family don't always
Mean that they blood 'cause some people just
Don't give a nigga what some people tried to use my name

So all the fat we had to cut and I'm still
Walking with my six amp strut
Urban eyes see through camouflage
And now I know who's butt

So when I sent you tried to play me
All of a sudden now I'm shady
Maybe deep down in my heart
Never trust you from the start

Never hoped you'd be my homie, don't come 'round my way
And if we never speak again, it's got to be that way
This millennium, we'll be spankin' your heiny
Remind thee naughty invented family of the 90's

Lord, please tomorrow ain't promised to you nor me
So now we choose the roots, so we can plant new trees

Life doesn't end when the sweat dries
A time when a nickel cost a dollar
When you rise your chest dies
My dynasty many fear it 'cause I'm near it

Ancient Egyptian scriptures fitted in through hyroglyphics
Motherfuckers try to touch my mental state
Niggas smile up in your face and then they infiltrate
So it seems nowadays that the only plan

To get my people help my people get a load of land
And I'm'ma see it if I have to kill some shit
To make my family tree a motherfucking wilderness
See a black man standin' on the promised land

Since they broke every promise I devised a plan this
Black this and black that crap is gettin' touchy
Any black hat that cross my path, I call him lucky
Those who turn. they back with they fears

And try to before they can see us
They gonna need us sweet Jesus

See what started as a family forest

Clockin a double nickel on the L-I E
When it dawned on us that it was, ten o'clock
Turned on the tunes to hear the DJ's rock
The hands got to clappin, the fingers got to snappin
E and I was coolin, with his man's, he was snappin
In and out of fantasies on how large we can get
Coolin in rocks and Benzes with the ground effect kits
I wanted black, E was on the two-tone
Stupid boomin system with the hands-free phone
The dream gets better and I would like to go on
But I was brought back to reality by a toot of a horn
Smoke everywhere, oh just what we needed
On the way to shop our demo and the car overheated
Feelin' real low, low enough to die
Holdin' up traffic, on the FDR drive
We had to play ourselves, in the fresh dipped gear
E Double had to push while MD steered
There went our dreams, to cruise in golden limos
And all we kept sayin' was please listen to my demo

Please listen to my demo [x3]
Please-please-please-ple-please listen to my demo

In the year eighty-seven when we first took off
When I jumped to P-6-8 and broke North
Walkin' the big city streets of Manhattan
Buildings, whole nine yards, so enchantin
Thinkin' if we got a chance, we could rock it
Funky fresh demo tape in my pocket
We was walkin', and got dissed twice today
Then we stopped at 1974 Broadway
We walked in with grins on our chins
And P had juice from Mr. Virgo Simms
He played the tape and we started to laugh
Played ?if it was sock? and they swoop and backstab
People start to smile inside we buckwhylin
Sayin' this all started back from freestylin
They liked it, and they were very kind
But me and P was like, ""Yo E, where do we sign?""
Went in the backroom, things was luvy duvy
Met Ron Resnick, and his partner Juggy
Things was cool, as I remembered
We signed the dotted line, now we Fresh Record members
Had dreams, of fancy cars and limos

Lost the real scope of life.
The hope of life,
To cope with life,
And found it on the screen.

And how many times have we heard that line do you think
I'm blind to trade my mind for what you call fine.
Never in my time I'm not in your movie.

Hey, what can it be on the big white screen
Hey how can you see you're living in 3D.

I guess you think you're at the movies somewhere.
Stale popcorn don't you stand in your chair stale popcorn
Don't you stand in you chair.

To take advantage of this truth is cold hearted sin.
So I say to youth right now.

No matter what they say,
Never give in."

No arrow or a neon sign
No heavenly angels sang on high

I just knew
Positively certain that you were the one for me
I just knew
Definitely sure in love and anyone could see
We were meant to be
A part of history made for me and you
It was already set from the moment we met
I just knew

Don't get me wrong I could feel the heat
My heart beat fast, I could barely breathe
It was a genuine, pre-designed epiphany
That came over me
Maybe it's intuition
But I've learned to listen to my heart

Your style to my style you can't hold a candle to it
Equinox symmetry and the balance is right
Smokin' and drinkin' on a Tuesday night

It's not how you play the game it's how you win it
I cheat and steal and sin and I'm a cynic
For those about to rock we salute you
The dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to

I once was lost but now I'm found
The music washes over and you're one with the sound
Who shall inherit the earth? The meek shall
And yo, I think I'm starting to peak now, Al

And the man upstairs I hope that he cares
If I had a penny for my thoughts I'd be a millionaire
We're just 3 M.C.'s and we're on the go
Shadrach Mesach Abednego

Only 24 hours in a day
Only 12 notes, well a man can play
Music for all and not just one people
And now we're gonna bust with the Putney Swope sequel

More Adidas sneakers than a plumber got pliers
Got more suits than Jacoby &amp; Meyers
If not for my vices and my bugged out desires
My year would be good just like Goodyear's tires

So I'm out pickin' pockets at the Atlantic Antic
And nobody wants to hear you 'cause your rhymes are damn frantic
I mix business with pleasure way too much
You know, wine and women and song and such

I don't get blue I gotta mean red streak
You don't pay the band your friends and that's weak
Get even like Steven like pulling a Rambo
Well Shadrach Mesach Abednego, you know

Steal from the rich and I'm out robbing banks
Give it to the poor and I always give thanks
Because I got more stories than J.D. got Salinger
I hold the title and you are the challenger

I've got money like Charles Dickens
I got the girlies in the Coupe like the Colonel's got the chicken
Always go out dapper like Harry S. Truman
I'm madder than Mad's Alfred E. Neuman

*Never gonna let them say that I don't love you*

Well, my noggin is hoggin' all kinds of thoughts
Adam Yoggin is Yauch and he's rockin' of course
Smoke the holy chalice got my own religion
Rally round the stage and check the funky dope musicians

Like Jerry Lee Swaggert or Jerry Lee Falwell
You love Mario Andretti 'cause he always drives his car well
Vicious circle of reality since the day you were born
And we love the hot butter on what? The popcorn

Sippin' on wine and mackin'
Rockin' on the stage with all the hands clappin'
Ride the wave of fate it don't ride me, homes
*Being very proud to be an M.C.*

And the man upstairs I hope that he cares
If I had a penny for my thoughts I'd be a millionaire
Amps and crossovers under my rear hood
Because the bass is bumpin' from the back of my Fleetwood

They tell us what to do? Hell no!

That you welcome me today

Let your thoughts drift to me
Why it's I have parted from you

The nights are so long
With the heartache for you

Because of your cruel ways

'Til our troubles are all through
Beyond the river of Jordan
I'll still be waiting for you
Because of your cruel ways
I may never live to know

I'll forgive you before I go

When you see my grassy mound
Then our troubles, all through
My days have been shortened
Whilst I've been waiting for you
Because of your cruel ways
I may never live to know
In justice to my true love
I'll forgive you before I go

And it did not read ""for two""

And stay on Earth with you

Could be the things I've eaten,
Could be the first shot fired,
Could be a web of deception,
One step left of my direction,

Shake the children from their beds,
Let the Mrs. put on her housecoat,
And a prayer for mercy said,
With all of this welling up inside,
We're headed for the edge of town,
And we're walking the distance
Without a sound but our tears rolling down.
But our tears rolling down.

Oh, to understand myself,
Why I feel the way I do,
I can't depend upon my feelings,
They could be anything but true,
Could be I stayed up too late last night,
Could be the morning news,
Could be that I'm not perfect yet,
I got a long way to go, I must admit.

I hope they play this on the radio
Gimme a chance to let somebody know
That we can
Change the world, one boy one girl
One person at a time (in time)

Well I know your station's got to pay the bills
And there's only so many slots to fill
But I'm just trying to bring 'em something real
And if FM won't, surely AM will &amp; play
Change the world, one boy one girl
One person at a time
Change the world one boy one girl
One person at a time (in time)

Sure be nice to go triple platinum
There's no guarantee it's ever gonna ever happen
And if I can only reach one set of ears
I know that I've fulfilled my purpose here to

J'ai mis mon adolescence √† comprendre combien j't'aimais
Le jour o√π j'tai roul√© ma premi√®re galoche
Tu m'as tap√© dans l'≈ìil avant qu'j't'aie dans la poche

Depuis ma vie s'r√©sume √† une course-poursuite
Chaque fois qu'je tente de t'effleurer dis-moi, pourquoi tu prends la fuite¬†?
Avec toi, √ßa va, √ßa vient
Sans toi j'suis un vaurien

D'ailleurs le temps c'est du toi
Du chagrin j'l'ai gros sur la patate
J'croque de toi sauf quand tu craques
J'ai les bourses qui s'r√©tractent
Ta courbe croissante m'enchante
Mais ta chute de reins me donne des vertiges et des crampes

T'es la personne la plus ouverte, tu connais pas d'fronti√®res
Tu parles toutes les langues et sait briser les barri√®res
Snob, la pauvret√© te fait horreur
Je t offrirai tous les parfums, toi qui n'as pas d'odeur

Tu n'fais pas l'bonheur
Procure du plaisir
Et plus j'te d√©sire et plus tu m'fais courir
J'te tire mon chapeau et tu m'en fais baver des ronds d'pi√®ces
Je t'aime autant qu'j'te d√©teste

T'es fra√Æche et bien roul√©e p√©p√®te
Tout l'monde te court apr√®s
Et j'arrive toujours le dernier

Quand apprendras-tu √† te poser¬†?

Ne me quitte pas
Il est para√Æt-il des placements fertiles
Donnant plus de bl√© qu'un meilleur avril
Je ferai un domaine o√π tu seras reine, o√π tu seras loi
Et m√™me, si ce domaine existe d√©j√†
Impr√©visible, soudain visible
D'autres t'ont pris pour cible
Reviens dans mes bras
Pour toi je serai cr√©dible
Au bal je t'ai invit√©e √† ma table
Et tu m'as snob√© pour aller danser avec un notable
Pendant qu'j'me faisais biaiser
D'autres avait d√©j√† appris √† savoir l√©ser
Au d√©but j'√©tais rong√© par la jalousie
Et puis j'ai bien vite compris qu'tu n'ferai jamais le bonheur d'autrui
Toutes ces formes font r√™ver mais dans l'fond y a rien
Impalpable, liquide, tu fonds dans leur main
√Ä peine ils tombent, tu lorgnes d√©j√† sur les voisins
Tu les rends possessifs, jaloux, radins et mesquins

T'es partie √† la conqu√™te do monde entier
Et l'monde entier a succomb√© √† tes charmes de papier
Aujourd'hui le monde entier est √† tes pieds
Mais t'es plus qu'jamais malheureuse comme les bl√©s

T'√©tais fra√Æche et bien roul√©e p√©p√®te
Maintenant t'es fade et fard√©e
Tu donnes le bras √† des riches p√©p√®te

Ooh, why can't I say how I feel?

I pan across the room,
And I see his face,
I start to cross the room,
With a quickened pace,
(Quick, quick, quick, quick.)
He brushes the side of me,
Like I always dreamed,
He stops... to look at me,
Oh sweet serendipity,

This is my chance I'll say it,
(This is my chance)
Nothing to fear,
(I'm gonna say how I feel)
I'm gonna ask him to dance
(And if he won't dance)
Another panic attack
(At least I said how I feel)

The very next night,
I see him once more,
It's not love at first sight,
It's more like lust encore,
He's floating my way,
And I'm hoping to catch his eye,
I'm not sure what to say,
Damn it, this time, he will be mine,

Ooh, I'm so sick,
Of all this indecision,
And the way, that just one look,
Can rock my body rhythm,

He's coming towards me,
At least I hope that's the case,
He's smiling at me,
And my pulse starts to race,
He's asking my name,
Politely he turns to my friend,
He's asking her the same,
(Oh no),
God Almighty will this tourment never ever ... end?"

5553,TRAPISC128F14671D3.h5,Gang Starr,Mostly Tha Voice (Explicit),"It's mostly tha voice, that gets you up
It's mostly tha voice, that makes you buck
A lot of rappers got flavor, and some got skills
But if your voice ain't dope then you need to (chill... chill...)

Up steps one, and he gets done
Then up steps another, he gets smothered
That's word to mother, or should I say moms
I drop bombs, scorchin niggaz like napalm
Sucka, boy, get off my shit
Get off my dick so what I make butter hits
You better change your behavior, battling Gangstarr
No religion could save ya
My religion is rap, R-A-P
R-E-A-L-I-T-Y, G
'Cause when I rock street kids rejoice
I got mad rhymes, still

So when you think you know the whole you don't even know the half
You're not a threat to myself, and neither to my staff
Not the type to really dance too much, although I used to
Rather bust a fresh line, and get loose to
The blunted ill types of beats Premier makes
Makes your girl's rear shake, let me set it straight

Some rappers use hooks to this shit
But if you took that shit out
And you took all the music out
What would remain? The voice no doubt
Bless my soul I control
When in pimp mode
My bank roll expands
I invest in my man
I plan, to keep rap real
So if your shit ain't fat then kneel
You squeal, feeling pain from my oral flex
What about oral sex, which chick's next
To open wide and get a chunk from a real brother
Yeah, some real funk from a real brother
They get sprung and most of them don't recover
But I don't diss 'em I just talk to em
Cause the sound, of my voice, it does a lot to em
So you and, the niggaz right there
Be aware, like SWV, I'm right here
Waitin to correct your ass
And if you don't follow now I'll disrespect your ass
More Vicious than Sid, do a crime with no bid
I tell a bitch that I didn't when you know that I did
Take a trip to a land a-far
Then come back, and people still know Gangstarr
See I'm the ladies choice
'Cause I got crazy styles, still

Outro: Guru, Shug

Oh shit Shug, whattup
(Whassup money?)
Just loungin, about to go do this shit in the studio
(Oh yeah, you just let me get on that shit
You always said I could get on, you need to let me get on that)
Word?
(For real man)
Yo man
(Don't front on that shit)
I'm sayin' yo, if I let you get busy, youknowhatI'msayin
You can't be dissapointin me
(I flip shit, I'ma flip shit on this)

One day they will use every little things against me

A friend of mine, gave me an advice
He said be careful and think twice
Before you talk about your life
Protect yourself just keep quiet

The more they know the harder they try
To spoil your ways to spread lies
And even though I know he could be right I
Just said I

Eso me has dado pero yo quiero m√°s.

Un paseo cerca del mar
Con una copa de licor sin licor
Cari√±o a medias, medio amor
Eso me has dado pero yo quiero m√°s
Quiero mucho m√°s.

S√≥lo es un cachito de ti
No me llega nunca a saciar
Y yo quiero mucho m√°s.

Hit the wall,
Scream out loud,
As you start to crawl
Back in your cage
The only place
Where they will
Leave you alone.
'Cause the weak will
Seek the weaker till they've broken them.
Could you get it back again?
Would it be the same?
Fulfillment to their lack of strength at your expense,
Left you with no defense;
They tore it down.

And I have felt the same as you,
I've felt the same as you,
I've felt the same.

Locked inside
The only place
Where you feel sheltered,
Where you feel safe.
You lost yourself
In your search to find
Something else to hide behind.

The fearful always preyed upon your confidence.
Did they see the consequence,
When they pushed you around?
The arrogant build kingdoms made of the different ones,
Breaking them till they've become just another crown.

Refuse to feel anything at all,
Refuse to slip,
Refuse to fall.
Can't be weak,
Can't stand still,
You watch your back 'cause no one will.
You don't know why they had to go this far,
Traded your worth for these scars,
For your only company.
And don't believe the lies
That they have told to you. Not one word was true
You're all right, you're all right, you're all right."

Awake, angels of lunacy,
Arise, avatars of chaos,
Incinerate yourselves,
In the blaze of Babylon,
Hierophants of the Hurricane,
We invoke the Eidolon.

Unleash the storm...

We renounce the sin,
Of mortal fallacy,
Bestow upon us,
Our stellar legacy.

Peel the benighted shells,
From our radiant cores,
We obey the laws,
Of finitude no more.

Ascend...
In Akasha to Procreate.
Strip the flesh from your soul,
Extend...
Open the Silver Gate...
Melt yourself beyond all control.

Give birth to the vision,
Let enter the voice,
And dare not falter,
Lest the demons eat you.
Confide in your Nuit,
Never your senses.

Nine apparitions,
The nails of Yod,
Drip from the moon
As unhallowed blood,
Anubis' terror to feed you,
As the night condenses.

Ascend...
In Akasha to Procreate.
Strip the flesh from your soul,
Extend...
Open the Silver Gate...
Melt yourself beyond all control.

In poisoned aberration,
Tarnished minion abide,
Convocating execrations,
To drown and smother, to divide.

Recline, Rejoice,
Discard the body,
And savour this, your threnody,
Divine by lust alone,
And second skin,
As the eyes turn to stone,
Let the heave begin!

Azazel!
Shemhazai!
Rejoin your kin in faith and fate!

Heed not the warnings,
We invoke the manyfold
Ny-Ar-Rut-Hotep
For we know,
There is no peace at the gate,
There is no peace at the gate...

Ascend,
In Akasha to procreate,
Strip the flesh from your soul,
Extend, open the Silver Gate,
Melt yourself beyond all control,
In Akasha to procreate,
Disembodied, unfettered souls,
Open the Silver Gate,
We embrace the stars
With twin black holes"

My only lesson was in my brains
But I traded them for my hand
Not a smart move, a repeat move
Does this put pay to our plan?

Hey, hey,
You'll never get to heaven if you don't give back
So give back a little twist
If you wanna a lend a hand,
Wait, wait
Don't leave before I'm finished
If you do then that's rude
You may learn a little bit about those things you do

I'm only going to heaven if it feels like hell
I'm only going to heaven if it tastes like caramel

Give me that Sunday school answer. Try to make it all okay

Does it hurt to know I'll never be there?

*Phone dialling*
(Hello?)
Hello, it's '91. Buckle up, guard your grill! Hee hee
(Har what the fuck?)
Has this ever happened to you?
Can you name this tune?
These victims knew how to guard they grill, this would've never happened!

Verse 1: Treach

I put two and two together and I came up with four
You are forever, forgot, forbid, shouldn't have to say much more
I been through more crews than a flute, yeah I'll show ya
This is so damned scrap I betcha bro don't know ya
You tried to get cool and say peace, save that peace for a jigsaw
Stay back and watch a real MC get raw
I never know, never know when another will come to diss this
But if and whenever they come I'm runnin' this merry fist miss
I shooker the crook and shaker the fake to get like a quick stick
It's just another one dud and is dismissed
Kitty guard your grill, well be for real, you ain't built
I'm silly-ho smackin MC's on a ninety degree tilt
The reason that it's tilted 'cause you're guilty, too hard to guard
It's not you're tryin' too gay, you're tryin' too hard
How hard can your guard be, I say wuz up?
Guard your grill, knuckle up, put 'em up, yup!

Guard your grill, knuckle up
I ain't the type to give up
Guard your grill, knuckle up
I smoke first, so what's up
Guard your grill, knuckle up
Put 'em up, you ain't tough
Guard your grill, knuckle up!

Verse 2: Treach

I give 'em much business, an Aspirin
Damn, I love a glass chin
What are ya askin for mercy, I'm laughin'
Huh, you know the game, you know the name and you know the rep
You know the Kay, you know the Vin and you know the Treach
There's no sleepin', no nottin, no rest and hey
No snoozin, no dozin, no f'in way
Heapin things up like a Coke cup
Wind me up but y'all I gets the low wits tha rough stuff
And after enough to cut ya off a piece, still have nuff
Then go around to them and him because ??? ???
I I got posse full a fighters all fly like a chopper
Use to couldn't take 'em out 'cause they was rowdy hip-hoppers
There's so much gold for roast, the ??? don't knock us
My nuts are my only homies that can hang proper
At school I had a lot, I filled with VCR's and Vodka
I had two girls, one a runner, one a trotter
Back then I wore briefs, tella starter, gettin' hotter
Then I grew yeah long so I had to switch to boxers
How hard can your guard be, I say what's up?
Guard your grill, knuckle up, put 'em up, duck

Verse 3: Treach

I don't lay, I lie, who knows like Pinnochio
Never been to Tokyo or *?Keeper's Day Bolochio?*
Guard your grill, here's a feel, I rush hard
I got the fliest ride out here, the '91 bus card
So callin me for a ride ain't the answer
Huh, you want a lift ya better pick up a transfer
Sayin' we will go for one cut, now we're dead
Oh yaeh, that's bout as funny as Barbara Bush in a bobsled
Now how wrong can you be to think we play
Even a broken clock is right at least twice a day
So now ya feelin' real low, ya no flow-crow
You slow hobo, stiffer than Robo
Oh, here's another side of bein real quick
You might speak it fulla cracks, but you still ain't shhh...
So don't try at those same style battle cry
I rock the U-train, the routes that I battle by
I listen to sister shit, it till they quite slow
No matter that white rap, shoot a pharoah with a psycho
Put down ya handgun, up which'cha hands son
Look cops they come, I ain't the damned one
I was only three steps from a peace prize
Pieces laid, piece of his eyes and his left thigh
Knuckle up, put 'em up, yeah guard your grill
And that's comin' from Illtown, down the hill

(Vin Rock) This goes out to the 118th Street Posse
My man J Scratch in the house, y'knowhutI'msayin?
And oh yaeh, pss pss pss pss
(Kay Gee) Don't forget, guard your grill, knuckle up!
(Treach) A strong what up to my man Kid Capri
(KG) This goes out to my man Jack Don
I gotta say what's up to my man Pop Dezzy Dezza
(T) What's up to Clark Kent and my man Face!
(KG) This goes out to my man Fitz and the whole Down The Hill
'Cause they know how to definitely guard they grill
(Vinny) I gotta say what's up to my man Dre and Easy in the house
(T) This goes out to my man Tamere
He's definitely in here
What's up to my homey Kool G Rap and my Brand Nubian brothers
Special shoutout to my man Grand Puba, one of the fiercest MC's out
There
Peace goes out!
(Vinny) Peace to my man Frank Ben, we outta here

Ayo the Nuts landed, so back it up
Pass the mic to big Psych, the manufacterer
The architect, bringing you the art of wreck
You used to hate my click, now you want a part of it
We coming with more hits that funk like Parliament
Comparing me to another's going to lead to an argument
The heat we fry you with, straight from the armory
Guerilla army, we kill tracks and harmonies
My Nut orchestra blowing fuses
Your amp can't hold this music, it's booming
I'm in my truck cruising, 97 tuned in
The latest news is the Nuts new album is ruling
Y'all vs. the Nuts, you have a big chance of losing
(There's no escaping this) Or confronting the union
So stop fooling yourself, and feel these Nuts
Cause (No one's ready to deal with us) What?

(No escaping this) (Repeat 3x)

Don't be humble, it's better to pull
Belive you eligible, get left like a vegetable
Man it's crazy and there's no escape
It's turned into a police state
The average cat don't even know his fate
Walking round like he hurting something
And there's nothing that he got to say that's even worth discussing
Listen to me, it's better to be
Lying dead with honor, soldier, than to never be free
Young niggas out here losing they dads
In the battle of the son of the fags
Every other country burning the flag
Don't let history repeat itself
That's how the devil plan to keep his wealth and feed himself
I'm the New York power hitter
Hit the devil in the fucking shitter
Take his manhood and all his glitter
Got guns ready to bust

Still hating everyone
As I detest you
I do not feel wrong

Searching for my youth
Trying to digest it all
Searching for the truth

You were crying I grabbed the keys and said goodbye
Well hang on please don't hang up let me talk to our machine
I've had all this time to think about what you mean to me

I know you said it's over but my hearts telling me that ain't right
I know it can't be over 'cause I still wake up reaching for you in the night
It took leaving for me to realize there's good in goodbye

I'm listening to the talking should I pick up the phone
And lay my pride aside and say come home
I've played that moment over time and time again
When giving up seemed easier than just giving in

I'll try to call you one more time

And sometimes life can be so cruel
It will pick you up and drop you down again

So if you try to love me darling please refrain
I'm still searching for the pieces
Someone else once took away
You know I used to love with all my heart
But how the times they can change.

Oh my baby's been calling and I want you to know
I'm not letting him down I'm just letting him go
Oh I never wanted to be apart
But I still don't know if I'm a wounded heart.

I've seen a lot of heartache and I've walked a lonely road
They say the darkest times before the dawn
But the rooster hasn't crowed
And when you wake up in the morning
Oh my darling I'll be gone

Oh my baby's been calling and I want you to know
I'm not letting him down I'm just letting him go
Oh I never wanted to be apart
But I still don't know if I'm a wounded heart
No I still don't know if I'm a wounded heart.

So many fools fall in love
And it's a crying game
It's a crying shame
That I'm not a fool in love
But I know what I'm feeling
And my heart is still healing

Are taking you for granted

The formless fires of Amenti unfold

Not nearly as frenzied as disorder that I bring

Is it the renaissance of my rigid existence?
Is there a future for me beyond the stars?

How can I get up, why should I get up
This whole world's gone crazy
Think I've seen enough
I'm gonna sleep forever why get up

Phone keeps ringing right off the hook
Some bill collector, I know what cooks
Think I'll stay in bed, dream all day
World outside bugs me anyway
When I get things going, the going gets rough
So I ask myself why get up

Went to the doctor, he said lose some weight
If you don't do it quick, we'll have to operate
I talked to my lawyer, he said case is closed
That woman got it all even the garden hose
Staring at the ceiling thinking just my luck
Better roll back over why get up

Well I can't quit drinking, I'm nervous all the time
When I wake up, it's like a ton lead on my mind
What was it, I said to that girl last night
She really got upset, I best stay out of sight
I remember a gun and calling somebody's bluff
I better duck under the cover why get up"

Which one is etched along your headstone,
Bygone, remote, and cast aside?
Did you hold it in your hands every single night?
Did you wash them in the waters of a grave?

Silence in sovereign fleet the hand that dare seize the fire.
Struggle to sound above the piercing,
Echo trill of this hapless, bloody sigh.
Stalking in this fearful symmetry the trail back,
To the hammer, the chain, and the furnace.

Slowly they will tarnish and break.
The tiger utters not his own name.
And in triumph, and in glory,
Our earth is blackened. 
In solace do we sing.

I'm not ashamed.
If blood is what you ask,
Then I have nothing to offer.

Your ghost is leaving; it has undone itself.
In death they do speak low into our ears,
""I've been waiting for this,""
Unchanging."

He's just an old memory
That don't remember me
And I can't get over him
Though it's been so long since he chose to leave
And I'm a grown woman
I should've already set myself free
From that old memory that don't remember me
He don't remember me

But I remember the smell of his cologne
And tonight he has it on
And I remember the feel of his skin
And I can't help but go back there again

Tonight...
The stars are aligned and the planets colliding
And the plan is arriving and she's out there smiling
The fear is upon us, the skies tried to warn us
Your parents are goners, no children to mourn
It's driving me crazy, this war is my lady
These bombs are our babies and God is amazing
The tick of the timer, the slip of your rival
The pimps and the rise of your pulse, where you'll find her
Hey hey 

(Chorus - Matthew Santos)
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight

(Verse One - Lupe Fiasco)
Disease, the virus is spreadin' in all directions
No safe zone, no cure and no protection
No symptoms to find, the signs of an infection
No vaccines, remedies and no corrections
Quarantine your dreams and sever all connections
Don't let 'em in not a friend, not a reflection
Everybody's got it and wants you to have it next and
Don't accept 'em if you want to stay as an exception
No pill can heal the ill of this
Sickness some are still in doubt of its existence
Some call it forgiveness and some call it the vengeance
Some say it's an exit, some say it's an entrance
The poor say the rich have the cure
The rich say the poor are the source
Revolutionaries say it's psychological war 
Invented by the press just to have something to report
Some say the first case came from a maternity ward
Some say a morgue, some say the skies, some say the floors
""Whores,"" say the nuns, ""nuns,"" say the whores
And everybody is sure
The scientists say, ""it only infects the mind""
The little boy said, ""it only infects the girls""
The preacher man said, ""it's gonna kill off the soul""
A bum said, ""it's gonna kill the whole wide world""

(Chorus - Matthew Santos)
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her finger
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her finger
Streets are on fire tonight

(Verse Two - Lupe Fiasco)
Believe! Some say the neon signs by the loud speakers repeatin' that everything is fine
A subtle silence to demolish the trouble conscience of accomplished with no knowledge and every freedom denied
Every dream is designed and broadcasted from the masses to the masses from the antennaes on top of the shrines
Was fine and received and planted during the panic and surely it reports back everything in your mind
Everything is lyin', everything is dyin'
Everying is a rule, everything is a crime
Everything was here then everything rewind
New weather burned the feathers off everything flyin'
(And she likes it, and she loves it)
The sadness, the madness, the bad shit, the lavish, the fastest, the clashes
The ashes to ashes, everything intertwined
My femme fatale, my darlin' fallen angel
Once caught her changin' the batteries in her halo
Receipt for wings and everything that she paid for
And the address to the factory where they made those
The scientist said, ""she's already inside my mind""
The little boy said, ""what happened to all the girls?""
The preacher man said, ""she's gonna kill off the soul""
The dope boy said, ""it's the whole wide world""

(Chorus - Matthew Santos)
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight"

So close I sear you
Seeing, believing
Dreaming, deceiving

A place between sleep and awake

I dare to enter your ecstasy
Lay yourself now down to sleep
In my dreams you're mine to keep

Tra√≠an 500 paquetes de esos que pesan un kilo
Los federales por tierra se las bajaron a tiros
Pensaban llevar la carga a la Ciudad de Tijuana.

Los estaban esperando ya estaba todo planeado
Para entregar el encargo a un narco del otro lado
Con esta ya van tres veces dijo Modesto Quintero
Que se pierden cargamentos eso es bastante dinero.

Si sigue la cosa as√≠ vamos a perder terreno
No va a ver de otra compita tenemos que negociar
Algunos miles de verdes a la ley le voy a dar
Y cuando crezcan las ventas lo voy a recuperar.

Hay que cuidar el negocio y mantenernos activos
Pagarle bien a los socios hacerlos nuestros amigos
Porque la ley es la ley mas vale estar bien unidos
Ya burlaron a la ley ya surtieron los pedidos.

Por esto Quintero vive en los Estados Unidos
Gastando mucho dinero que da el negocio prohibido"

I should have said, ""No, someone's waiting for me...""

I can't take it back, what's done is done

And it eats me from inside, that she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

She fell away
Shed me like a skin
She fell away
Left me holding everything

Once the road lay open like a girl
And we drank and laughed and threw the bottle over
But she fell away
She fell away
I did not see the cracks form
As I knelt to pray
I did not see the crevice yawn, no

Sometimes
At night I feel the end it is at hand
My pistol going crazy in my hand
For she fell away
O she fell away
Walked me th the brink
The fell away
I did not see her fall
To better days
Sometimes I wonder was she ever there at all

And ties it down with imbeciles

She said ""Son, you feel kinda warm""
And she looked into her crystal ball
Said ""You're in love"" 

Said it could not be so
Not with all the girls I know
She said when the next one arrives
Looking into her eyes 

I left there in a hurry
Looking forward to my big surprise
The next day I discovered
That the fortune teller told me a lie 

I hurried back down to that woman
As mad as I could be
I told her I didn't see nobody
Why'd she make a fool out of me 

Then something struck me
As if it came from up above
While looking at the fortune teller
I fell in love 

Now I'm a happy fellow
Well I'm married to the fortune teller

You ready?

Get up, history in the making
Part two, it's so crazy right now

I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row

Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love you're doing no one else can

No no
No no

When I talk to my friends so quietly
Who he think he is? Look at what you did to me
They assure me, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress

The way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how the love you're doing no one else can

Yes sir I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur, chinchilla

Been dealing with chain smokers
But how you think I got the name Hova?
(No no)

Fall back young, ever since the label changed over

To platinum the game's been wrap, one

I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby I don't care

Under any circumstance Jah message you have to hear
No matter where you go, Jah is always there
So in the face of evil InI have no fear

Well city life is the shitty life for me
Too much confusion up in Falsen'dun, D.C
People rushing with no place to go
No direction - InI have to cool and take it slow
Even when I am driving in my car
Or you don't get a chance to leave the city very far
Keep focused on truth with meditation and prayer
Jah will show you you can go anywhere...

So be aware, and your mind must be clear
Under any circumstance Jah message you have to hear
No matter where you go, Jah is always there
So in the face of evil InI have no fear

Walking through the woods with your backpack full of gear
Is fine, but realize that you've got to be aware
I know it's hard, and I'm glad to be there
But I will see so much more if my mind stays clear
Jah is speaking just listen to the birds

'Cause the plants and the animals are all messengers
So seek, and you will find relation
'Cause Jah earth and all in it, we are one creation

So be aware, and your mind must be clear
Under any circumstance Jah message you have to hear
No matter where you go, Jah is always there
So in the face of evil InI have no fear

Check it...
There were men who used to live that way
They didn't need guns or knives to survive in those days...
Till Babylon came with their false reality
The earth used to provide more than we could ever need
Now it seems like we're going the wrong way
""Forward ever, backwards never"" as the wise man say
Let us go back to the way they used to live
So the earth can be around for our children's kids

To be aware, and your mind must be clear
Under any circumstance Jah message you have to hear
No matter where go Jah is always there
So in the face of evil InI have no fear"

Taking a mistake I gotta make
Then I'm glory bound
So I packed it up and I went to the winds
And I lived out of a VW bus for a year or two
Ain't nothing but a pipe dream and my guitar
Livin' off of apple fields and old cigars
Diggin this microphone checking it out every night all alone
The car battery is dead again so I got my head dead set against it

Until the dark days came

Its often he who's first to criticize what he
Is seeing another man doing
He often hides the wrong he does in his wrong-doing
He's justifying, children
Speak the truth 'cause it what it will
'Cause he who hide the wrong thing that he does
Do the wrong thing still
Wrong thing still he keeps on doing
His wrong-doing he's justifying
Oh Lord I know to some of them I say
The truth is an offence but never a sin
Ina your rights can never be wrong
In every man heart, the truth must be strong
So in every day, in every way, children
I know Jah won't forsake thee no
I know Jah won't forsake thee no
No Jah won't forsake thee if you do the right
No Jah he won't forsake thee no
But if the wrong thing still you keep on doing
Your wrong-doing you're justifying

Its often he who's first to laugh aloud
When he is seeing another man falling down
He often stays away
Never seeing what he could be doing"

What you are and when you blame
Everyone, you broken king
Watch you change the frame or
Watch you when you take your aim
At the sum of everything

'Cause you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can choose what you take
Why you gotta break and make it feel so hard

You lay there in the street
Like broken glass reflecting pieces of the sun
But you're not the flame
You got the people passing by
Because you know what you don't like
It's just so easy, it's just so easy

But you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can choose what you take
Why you gotta break and make it feel so hard

Oh and you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can choose what you take
Why you gotta break and make it feel so hard

You draw so many lines in the sand
Lost the fingernails on your hands
How you're gonna scratch any backs?
Better hope that time will take our lines away
Take all our lines and

Hope that time will take our lines and
Hope that time will take our lines away
Take all our lines away"

E credi che nei reality show sia tutto vero
Ma sta gente quando torna a casa piange sul serio
Perch√© tutto √® finto, perch√© tutto √® finito
Sono troppo polemico ho testi implosi

Took one look at that mercury, forty below
No life for a lady
To be draggin' her feathers around in the snow

Leaving me blue, off she flew
To the Tangipaho, down in Louisiana
Where a two-timin' jaybird
Met the divine Miss O
I'd like to ruffle his plumage

That Baltimore Oriole
Messed around with that big guy
'Til he singed her wings
Forgivin' is easy, it's a woman like, now and then
Could happen to thing

Send her back home
Home ain't home without her warbling
How she can sing
Make a lonely man happy, Baltimore Oriole

Come down from that bough
Fly to your daddy now

I've been bleeding

Good things make you smile
May someone remember who moved them?
There's secret life in this side
Remember, forgive and forget them!

A hand that moved too soon
A heart that recovered its direction
Countless lines you just sing
Decisions open to suggestion

There's a prophecy, that tonight many men will die
The fire will burn forever in our passionate hearts
Our destinies are calling us now
We are ready to take their lives

Into battle we ride with Gods by our side
We are strong and not afraid to die
We have an urge to kill and our lust for blood has to be fulfilled
WE'LL FIGHT TILL THE END! And send our enemies straight to Hell!

Prominent leaders, cast your swords in the wind as a sign of war
Men, prepare for death, 'cause we might never return

Blood will spill and heads will fall
As the swords sparkle, lights the night
The ground rumbles as we attack
In the throes of rage, we will fight
The lightning's flash, the thunder's roar
Will petrify the weak
We'll show no mercy, we'll kill them all!
We are sworn in the name of steel

Into battle we ride with Gods by our side
We are strong and not afraid to die
We have an urge to kill and our lust for blood has to be fulfilled

What should I do when nothing is right?

How do you know you're going the right way?

Or do you prefer to have your whole life haunted
By the ones who choose to care for you?

Beware of their motives, my friend
Take care you're still there at the end
Watch out for winter, it'll bite you with cold
Black spirits trying hard to bribe you with gold

Oh yeah

Would you steal a nickel from a blind man?
Well right now, I do believe you would
It's not the thought of you doing it that hurts me
It's the mind behind it that's no good

Filled with secrets she hid
And in a dusty old attic, one mornin I read
About a woman I never met
Who had dreams just like mine
With every page that I turned, the words came alive

Wish I could roll out of town like a run-away train
I'll do as I dare, let them call me insane
I'll never sit on the sidelines of life, I'll dance every dance
If I just had the chance

A tear fell on that faded page
Cause this was somebody else
Not the mama I knew who never thought of herself
But the times, they were different then
And lines just didn't get crossed
And these words that she wrote, they somehow got lost

Wish I could roll out of town like a run-away train
I'll do as I dare, let them call me insane
I'll never sit on the sidelines of life, I'll dance every dance
If I just had the chance

The chance that she never had
Is now the gift that is mine
And out here on this road, I'm makin' up for lost time
Yeah, I am my mother's child
And tonight in this car
I've got her words in my suitcase and her dreams in my heart

As I roll out of town like a run-away train
I'll do as I dare, let them call me insane
I'll never sit on the sidelines of life, I'll dance every dance

When you were standing there 
Set in your way was that you were not blind 
You were sure to make a fool of me 
Cause there was nothing there 
That you could see 
That could go beyond your mind 
Now who's standing at the door 
Remembering the days before 
And asking please be kind 
It isn't how it was set up to be 
But I've set you free this time 

I have never been so far out in front 
That I could ever ask for what I want 
And have it any time 
Knowing this you found a thought for me 
That told you just what I should be 
And there I stood behind 
With all the ones that went before 
And memories that always seems to 
Tear me from my mind 
In front of what it is you seem me to be 
I've set you free this time 

I could never find a chance to choose 
Between a way to win or a thing to lose 
Because there was your stand 
On top of all the love you took 
There was only something 
You can look at lying in your hand 
Now who's wondering what has changed 
And why it can not be arranged 
To have each thing work fine 
It isn't how it was set up to be 
But I'll set you free this time"

Watching, what is it in your brain that never gets it?
One day I'll disappear to the answer locked in my
Head that you'll never see of feel,
A consumer

The more the body is pierced, tortured, wounded, humiliated
The more complete his man's victory over pain,
The greater man victory over pain,
The greater his victory over the flesh.

That people are a plague

No liability
They drain my life

I wouldn't treat you wrong 'cause I've been on
The hurtin' side of pain
I might not know what love is
But I know what it ain't

It ain't showin' up for dinner with a rose and Chardonnay
Then drinkin' by yourself
It ain't a postcard from Hawaii sayin' we can still be friends
But I met someone else
It ain't bold faced lies or alibis that cannot be explained
I might not know what love is
But I know what it ain't

It ain't a mink coat,
Forty pairs of shoes,
Two 14-carat anklets on my Mastercard.
It ain't walkin' in a pawn shop,
Recognizing her engagement ring,
She swore she lost.
It ain't bold face lies or alibis,
That cannot be explained.
I might not know what love is,
But I know what it ain't.

If you had all day I could tell you things
That would make a grown man faint
I might not know what love is
But I know what it ain't
Yeah, I know what it ain't"

She wouldn't trade it in, with none of she thangs

Well now she might of caught my ass like once or twice
But she'd rather stick with me, instead of rolling the dice
'Cause she know I'm official, so why take a chance
And end up with a over jealous sucka' romance
Love to see me get the lap dance every now and then huh
Never fuck around with her stripper girlfriends huh
Now that's living like, who's the boss
Yeah she liking the money, but she loving my sauce
Even though she approached by them big time ballas
She ain't having that cause ain't another like papa

Worked real hard for a supermarket chain

Said 'You'd look real cute in a magazine'
From that day things would never be the same

Shouting it out loud

Strutting with her head up in the clouds
Airheads, living out the dream
In glossy magazines for girls and boys
Airheads, nothing in between

Empty boxes making lots of noise
Ok! Hello!
Gotta get up I gotta go
Paris, London, Tokyo, New York

She was front-page news on the Daily Blah
Kiss and tell with a superstar
Someone should have told her not to talk
Yesterday she ran away
From the paparazzi lens
Is that the way to make new friends

Airheads, living out the dream
In glossy magazines for girls and boys
Airheads, nothing in between
Empty boxes making lots of noise

She's young, she's just having fun
So just let it be
She's just a fox on the run

And I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping

I'm zipping through the days at lightning speed
Plug in, flush out and fire the fuckin' feed

Heading for the overload
Splattered on the dirty road
Kick me like you've kicked before
I can't even feel the pain no more

But I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming (only get them off)
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping (only get them off)

It's all mesmerized all that inside me

The sunshine bores the daylights out of me
Chasing shadows moonlight mystery

Our hearts surge with feeling 'cause we agree
How the Spirit fills this moment
Holding us together in a bond of love
Such a mystery
Like a window looking out into eternity
But even though this feels like heaven
We know that it is just...

The edge of the dream
The start of the plan
It's the way we begin to understand
The endless stream
The depths of His love
We got a long way to go
But the thrill is to know
It's just the edge of the dream

Feel the strength, the tenderness
He's given us a glimpse of His Holiness
As our souls flow together
Let us step on over...

The edge of the dream
Into the heart of His plan
It's the way we begin to understand
The endless stream
The depths of His love
We got a long way to go
But the truth we must know

Lord we must search for Your wisdom
We want to live as Your children
And move closer, closer, closer
To the dream

The edge of the dream
The start of the plan
It's the way we begin to understand
The endless stream
The depths of His love
We got a long way to go

Find peace of mind and serenity
With a little help from modern chemistry

You're the very reason why they call it dope
Yellin' for someone to throw yo uthe rope
Tell all your friends they should try it
Just say yes... yes
Just say yes... yes

I don't know what they're saying
Russian roulette I'm playing
It's straight I should be staying
Inside a chapel praying
My conscience I'll be saving
For now I'll just keep saying yes

Now I'm age 43
Waiting by the phone for a new kidney
I wish I didn't have to hurt to take a pee
That's not gonna stop me

Open the gates of the past
With the key to our hearts
Dream of the years gone by
Centuries through mankind's eyes

In the wasteland that grows inside
Within me I shall find myself

Slowly walking, pacing front
See through these blind eyes
Stepping on shadows, touching air
Stones move as I stand still
Seek the answers in the skies
As we don't even know ourselves
Silent, as the sun sets before our eyes

In the wasteland that grows inside
Within me I shall find myself

For years of space technology
Still we haven't learned
Like children we explore
Things we can't yet comprehend

Open the doors of the past
With the beating of a heart
Dream as the years go by
Carrying our own cross
Seek the answers in the skies
As we don't even know ourselves
Silent, as the sun sets before our eyes"

You made it clear you wasn't just another MySpace mistress

And I didn't take it personal
When you ignored my request to be your friend I spilled my guts and hit send
Waited 2 weeks for a response and got nothing
Honestly it only made me want you more

Week 4 rolled around and I was this close to letting go
But something wouldn't let me even though I hardly knew you
It was plain to see we were meant to lock lips
You knock me out with the brass knuckle tats on your hips

I was on this website late night lurking
When I got a message from you that was labeled urgent
You said you weren't impressed by lame dudes with no game
They're all the same tryin' to get your instant messenger name

But the fact that you hittin' me back made me smile
You must've saw somethin' you liked when you was skimming through my profile
You caught me at the most pivotal moment
So now I'm emailing my love with a dozen digital roses

So click approve, so simple
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose

Just click approve, you're killin' me here
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose

Let's face it, it's a sad situation when we have to resort to keyboards as a means of making relations
But I don't have the patience, I get straight to the point
So this is me at my most honest
No egos, no Gym Class status, just Travis

Love it or leave it, but you gotta admit
On a scale of one to awesome I'm the shit
Just get over it, it happened god damn it, I've been waitin too long
Even wrote a song about, like to hear it, here it go
If I'm being too annoying, let me know (just let me know)

But it's hard for me to not hate when I'm on MySpace
I never see my face in your Top 8
Approaching 6 weeks now, it's kinda obvious that you're either occupied or playing a game
All my money's on the latter, this is not a LOL matter
Why would you pass up a chance this great?

If there were two forces and I split them down the middle, I could swing back and forth for 3 days
Rephrase
If I had two horses, and I beat them with authority, I'd gallop all the way to Canada to see your face
But all I got is this Powerbook and iChat

Besides I hit you all the time and you never write back
I stay on my feet
Shit
And be persistent till my name is under who you would like to meet

So click approve, so simple
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose

Just click approve, you're killin' me here
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose

Who cares if we don't know each other's last name
All I know is that I'm smitten with your pictures wishin' you would feel the same
I admit I get a little jealous when other dudes leave you comments
Don't let it gas you up, it's all nonsense

Lately I been romancing the thought of me and you speaking in tongues in this mansion I bought
But it's all wishful thinking
Just give me some kind of sign to let me know I'm not freakin' you out
And if you lovin' what I'm speaking about, then say something

I check my inbox ten times and ain't nothin'
You probably busy doing something sexy
I just hope I'm in your thoughts next time you log in
And if not, ain't no love lost between you and me
I'll be here when your man ain't fully down as he used to be
So yeah it's time to sign out, my vision's getting blurry
This is madness, XOXO dash Travis

So click approve, so simple
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose

Just click approve, you're killin' me here
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose
So click approve."

Seen but I'm never heard by your lot

I ain't braggin, folks draggin me up and down the road
To be fucked up when I gets into my clownin mode
Then go to clown up on they ass like Bozo
Oh no, then dance on top of they asses like I was Jo Jo Dancer
Come Comet, come Dasher, come Prancer

I'm makin' 300 on my SAT and I am equal
Ain't no sequel, no saga, no way out, I'm nervous

To graduate is really becomin a very stressful journey
I feel like a steering wheel, for them is tryin' to turn me
Into a hate monger, and I'm wishin and I wonder
Damn, will I graduate before I hit the summer

I stood up and started moving with a childlike fascination
For those doors that don't have locks and the stairways that were blocked
So I dug through the obstruction, put my fist around the railing

And each step was far apart and far away from steps before it
And the air was getting thinner 'til I couldn't breathe at all
And if I happened to look behind me there were miles and miles of stairs
Enough so I couldn't see the doorway but I knew that it was there

And on the last step I was dizzy 'cause there were stairs in all directions
But I found another door and through the door there was the attic
Without old clothes, without a ceiling, everything had opened wide
Into the jaws of something bigger and suddenly I saw that I was

Upstairs and outside and
Freezing on the roof
Finally it had found me

The bus comes early from the bottom estate,
The weekend was blue, and so are you,
Sad boy

Front seat, top deck, look at the view,
Wish you were 14 and going to school,
Can't forget what your girlfriend said to you
Last night - she said

You should put an advert in the music press,
'Sensitive boy needs a girl in a flowery dress',
You're like bubblegum on my shoe,
Need a stick to get rid of you,
You're like bubblegum on my shoe,
Can't get it off, can't get off on you

Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble,
Bubble, bubble, bubblegum,
Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble,
Bubble, bubble, bubblegum,
Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble,
Bubble, bubble, bubblegum

Bus pulls up in the middle of town,
But you don't go to work, you just hang around,
Take a degree in self-pity,
Sad boy

Sit in a cafe, buy a cup of tea,
Put the change in the bandit, lose 50p,
Going round in your head are the things that she said,
So hurtfully - she said

You should put an advert in the music press,
'Sensitive boy needs a girl in a flowery dress',
You're like bubblegum on my shoe,
Need a stick to get rid of you,
You're like bubblegum on my shoe,

Innocence and irony,
A a dark shade of fantasy as the serpent slips right into me
Living out your fallacy,
I'm just another casualty of casual insanity.

Summers white cause the sun has gone,
But it won't be long till tomorrow comes and you're on the run with what you've taken.
Knowing what I should have known, I'm staring at the telephone,
And I think our god has been and gone, but I'm still waiting.

A love without limits

To follow our hearts

Baby that's why were here
To love without fear

I lose myself in your touch
And finally I find that I am strong enough
To listen to this voice within
Telling me to throw all caution to the wind

'At least I think I was here asleep...
Is it possible, conceivable that I sleepwalked out of my
Apartment
And went berserk?'

(Aesop Rock)
In slipped rhythm
Fed a cycle bound by dilemma-debting vendetta
Escaped briefly back to my apartment
I parked in front the fan
And reminisce about the day I ran a mile with your heart in my
Hand
'Tesants get the New York home game
With real life shoot-em-up action
Thug, vagrant, yuppie, and art
Free game piece all included
I told this cat the earth was flat
He walked till his beard grew long enough to strangle himself
For being stupid
Brick-a-brak novelty
Spliced with that sixth pack odyssey
Godspeed Tequila worm future, be concerned
My feelings spread across the land reporting avalanche sightings
While my introverted side is flying cadavers on kite strings
I'ma never give, I'm juiced off ejection
I'm stubborn as a thousand born-against avoiding questions
From the alpha to the zed
I bake the date up for my pledge
To 'bay the traitor in the twice-forgotten favors that he bled
Not a creature stirred, it reeks of subway metal
Bevel-edge journalist chin on fish shenanigans
Recording mayhem with bonuses, benefits and break room
Mummified mannequins with future cleanse adamant
And skeleton in cabinet
This amalgam circus, got a ring of fire
Just big enough to shove my purpose in a circle
I'm known to dip dusk in a broken city curfew
Release the hounds and see which one can tractor trail and serve you (SUCKA!)
I lay the law down upon its belly
With my foot dug in between the third and fourth disk
Yelling 'Break yo'self!'

I'm the actualized data commission
Past penny tip jar donation arrangement
Rather far-fetched from stability
Took a heart pledge early on
Bled onto the drum doser
Plow in the metronome, home
Lone caddy corner to cock-eyed sound booster
Sensationally seismograph stabbin away on stone tablets
To sketch up out your future
I drifted out the main spelunking unit with watered down sand
But have canceled developed, courtesy America
Land of the free base
Home of the triplicate grill character
My sorta sideways tilt called pinball blinker
It citizens wander through ex-warrants steady bleed
With dilapadated winter jacket
I rock a crooked lid piece
A sweat a bit to make my Wookie ends meet
Pacifist willing to step into a friend's beef if needed
Wing clipper, I hierarch compassionate
Where they whine on some 'Daddy's gonna kill Ralphy' shit
Sucked the proverbial silver spoon to the parents quit
Apparently
Parasol spinnin casually like 'I'm an artist, please don't laugh
At me'
Ok, time to buckle the fuck down
Side of the wobbly system back to original form, pumpkin
You can catch the memoir in several dimensions
The joy of life logic, don't employ the spite process
Hence, your plight botches

'I don't know what got into me
I didn't mean to cause all that destruction
I'm sorry... so sorry'

Overwhelmed by laughter

Starry skies of stains
Ultimately sorry
Uneducated random strokes of pain

It's a chain going backwards through the veins
Must sew up this wound and run away

I can feel their strength
Through crooked-lightning desert pathways

Run and run and run the pathways
Branching off through time
Two lone-wolves shared
The utmost silence of the time

The uttermost of silence)

I know it's almost two, I know you should leave, but wait
I've thought it over and there's something I gotta say.

Why don't you spend the night? Somehow it seems so right
Why does it have to end so soon, please stay 'til the morning light
It's such a long way home, and you'd only be alone
Ah, come on now, why don't you spend the night?

Maybe I spoke too soon and maybe my timing's wrong
Or maybe it's something I shouldn't have said at all
But when I look in your eyes, I feel like we're almost one
Ah, something tells me the night's only just begun.

Why don't you spend the night? Somehow it seems so right
Why does it have to end so soon, please stay 'til the morning light
It's such a long way home, and you'd only be alone
Ah, come on now, why don't you spend the night?

I can sink or swim but either way I'm a goner
Piranhas in the ocean and the sky and in my bed
Piranhas keep on biting till they get inside my head

And everyone wants to take a little bite
Till they're suckin' on my bones, they're scrapin' at my life
I can sink or swim but either way I'm a goner
I'm on a sinking ship and surrounded by piranha
And we drop down, just a little more down

I see them all around - just a-waitin' and a-watchin'
I see it in their eyes as the floor keeps droppin'
I ain't gonna win but I won't go without a fight
Alone on a ship in a race against time
And it's runnin' out"

Still just a frail shook one

 In the foreign lands what you have seen?
 People have long sung songs about you
 Of devils and monsters you have fought

 I have been in the Underworld
 Can anyone believe that?
 I chopped down three devils there
 And saved the king's daughter

 Tell us, Kurbads, say the truth
 How did you descend into the Underworld?
 Did it really go easy for you?
 And how did you ever return back home?

 It was hard down there
 But I had powerful words with me *
 They helped and protected me
 Even Laima herself paved my way

 The Snake Witch bit my rope in two
 I fell back
 And was forced to go and find another way out

 The monstrous werewolf I overcame
 I helped a blind man
 Regain his eyesight
 The nestling of a great eagle
 I saved from the hail
 For such deeds Eagle repaid me greatly

 Great eagle carried me
 Out to the surface
 Then I arrived home at last
 That's how it was
 That's what happened to me in the Underworld

 I was born a child of iron
 A mother of steel gave me life
 I put on a jacket of iron
 A coat made of steel
 They struck at me, stabbed at me
 Like a block of oak
 They couldn't hit or stab me
 Like to a chunk of steel"

We've been gladly exempt we are racked with contempt
And we happily wish you this hurt
My skull is on fire with barbs and black spires
My synapses shriek in the flames
Yet we reel with desire though chocked by coarse wire
We've been loosed by our raging disdain

I'm gone, God help me I'm done
Nothing can stop me, I'm done

No fear no doubt I've bottomed out I've lost myself I'm letting go
No pride no me I've set them free I've lost my mind and now I know
No pain no death they're put to rest we leave them here we close the door
No earth no man, now take my hand nothing matters anymore

Oh the stage that we soil, the plans that we foil
The joke that we play on the world
And you drown in the oil, all wrapped up in the coils
Crushed under the stones that you've hurled
Still we march through the tombs through the darkness and gloom
And we shatter the columns of bone
And the world she breaks for the lives that she takes
She weeps as she dies all alone

The world is a husk to be peeled back and torn
My body a shell that now breaks
How I long to escape from the chains that I've worn
And hasten my greatest escape
And when I breathe my very last
Don't shed a tear for me
Discard the body that once was my prison
For I'll have been set free

And when the trumpets call us home and I am no longer bedded by pain
Our tears will be forever dried for the author of life knows my name
So we trample the hoards of the pointless and blank
We will die for the truth in our hearts
No force that exists will steal us from his hands
Nothing will tear us apart

Though the mirror is dull, the reflection obscured we look beyond the obtuse
And the world weighs down, beating us to the ground
But her efforts are of little use
The anointed one has purchased our souls death is battered and lifeless before me
The truth rains down for the children of Christ and the truth has set us free
And through it all we rise when we fall
Though the road grows more narrow before me
Though we ache though we cry never break, never die
The one truth there is sets us free"

And he didn't leave much to Ma and me
Just this ole guitar and an empty bottle of booze

Now, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me Sue

Well, he musta thought that it was quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from lots a folks
Seems I had to fight my whole life through

Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I'll tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I roamed from town to town to hide my shame

But I made me a vow to the Moon and stars
I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man that give me that awful name

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I'd just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew

At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table dealin' stud
Sat the dirty, mangey dog that named me Sue

Well I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn out picture that my mother had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye

He was big and bent and grey and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold, and I said
""My name is Sue!  How do you do?  Now you gonna die!""
Yeah!  That's what I told him

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down but to my surprise
Came up with a knife an' cut off a piece of my ear

I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kickin' and a-gougin' in the mud and the blood and the beer

I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile

Well, I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun but I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

And he said, ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it he's gotta be tough
And I know I wouldn't be there to help you along

So I gave you that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's that name that helped to make you strong""

Yeah!  He said, ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me and ya got the right
To kill me now and I wouldn't blame you if you do

But you oughta thank me before I die
For the gravel in your guts and the spit in the eye
'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue""
Yeah, what could I do?  What could I do?

I got all choked up and threw down my gun
Called him my Pa and he called me his son
And I come away with a different point of view

And I think about him now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him

Boom bash dash, I had to break, I had to getaway
Packed my bags, to leave for good, it was a Monday
Kissed my mother, gave my pops a pound
Then he hugged me, and then he turned around
I threw the duffelbag over my shoulder
It was time to get props kid, cause now I'm older
Time to fend for myself jack
So I'ma go for mine, and maybe never come back
Stopped at the lye spot before I hit the train station
Needed some boom for the mental relaxation
It took the last of my loot to make this move Troop
But I ain't even tryin' to work in a suit
Plus my aunt's got a room that's for rent
As long as there's no hoes and I don't come home bent
So fuck the bullshit I'm audi
I'm on a mission, 'cause if I stay I'll go crazy
I'm gonna make it god damnit
Out in B-R-double-O-K-Lyn, The Planet
They never fake it just slam it
Out in B-R-O-O-K-Lyn, The Planet

Crash boom bang I used to hang at Four Corners
And all the spots in Beantown where niggaz carry burners
But I was more turned on by the micraphone
So one cold morning, I left home
Next I'm smokin' blunts on?
Or workin in a mail room Uptown, feelin' sick and
Tired, of payin' all these fucked up dues
I wasn't tryin' to lose -- I refused
Had a chick Uptown, one in Queens and one in Jersey
Sometimes all you need to get by, is a girlie
But yo I still wasn't happy
I seen a lot of ill shit on my block, happen nightly
East New York is no joke kid
And peace to my man Hass doin' his bad
I went to Flatbush to buy incense and weed
Stopped at the bookstands for somethin' to read
That shit was rough cause my pockets was bare
And like the sayin' goes, sometimes life ain't fair
But in my heart there ain't no quittin
So I stayed up late, to write some rhymes to some rhythms
Seconds away from just flippin
But fuckit I'll maintain, one day I'll be hittin
See I'ma make it god damnit
Out in B-R-double-O-K-Lyn, The Planet
I'll never fake it just slam it
There in B-R-O-O-K-Lyn, The Planet

And you can, walk the walk talk the talk but don't flaunt
Cause little shorty's scheamin on your rings and fronts
But don't sweat it, cause that's the life out here
A lot of niggaz, be livin' real trife out here
I got my own place in Bed-Stuy
Known to many others, as Do or Die
Malcolm X Boulevard and Gates Avenue
Smokin' up the fat trey bags with the crew
Me and the niggaz Troy and Squeaky
Used to twist Dutch Masters, we got nice weekly
I used to build with the brothers by the spot
They had to hustle but they still knew a lot
To get my haircut had to go to Fort Greene
On Myrtle Ave, to get a fade with the sides clean
Then to Fulton just to look around
Just to roam around, and find a chick to go Uptown
And check a movie or some shit like that
I couldn't spend much but yo my game was fat
I remember this one chick, she brought me a beeper
Then one week later, she got me some sneakers
But then I stepped, 'cause I found out about her rep
And I ain't goin' out bein no bitch's pet
But anyway I used to lay up in the crib
Listening to Red and Marley, wishin I was on kid
Saved my dough, stayed on the down low
Lounged and drank 40's with Tommy, Hill and Gunsmoke
And Lil' Dap used to come by strapped
Nice off a L 'cause we stayed like that
Sometimes I used to miss my moms
Gunshots in the twilight, people fightin every night
But I'ma be aight still
'Cause I'ma keep writin shit and perfectin my skills
I'm gonna make it god damnit
Here in B-R-double-O-K-Lyn, The Planet
I never fake it just slam it
Here in B-R-O-O-K-Lyn, The Planet *echoes*"

A wound unhealing

If time will set you free...

Time now to spread your wings
To take to flight
The life endeavor
Aim for the burning sun
You're trapped inside
But you can still be free...
If time will set you free...
But it's a long long way to go

Keep moving way up high
You see the light
It shines forever
Sail through the crimson skies
The purest light
The light that sets you free...
If time will set you free...

Sail through the wind and rain tonight
You're free to fly tonight
And you can still be free...
If time will set you free...
And go high like the mountain tops
And go high like the wind don't stop
And go high

I know it's true
Into each life some rain must pour
But I'm so blue every night without you
It keeps on rainin' more and more

Why can't you come on home?
So that I won't have to be all alone
If you don't think that you'll be home soon

I guess I'll

I've been wearin' out these tires

I've got a rebuilt carburetor

I've got brand new spark plug wires

I'be been clutchin and a brakin

I've been up these hills and down

Her good love keeps me makin'

That Asheville turnaround



I've been working like the dickens

Trying to make a livin'

Just waitin for the weed to end

I try to pay attention

But it's hard to keep from thinkin'

Bout bein' in her arms again

There ain't a woman finer

Than the one in Carolina

At the top of Black Mountain Road

Friday comes around

I'll pour some coffee down

And buddy I'll be good to go



Now three hundred four

And a half miles one way

Puts me on her front pourch steps

I know what I got comin'

The kissin' and a huggin'

About as good as any man can get

For two days and two nights

Everthing's all right

Happy as a hardwood tree

The only thing wrong

When Sunday comes along

I've got to rocket back to Tennessee

After last chorus:

Just can't let her down

She's the best girl I have found

I make that Ashville turnaround."

Will you pause to break my heart?

Before you pass by
Will you pause to break my heart?

For here is where you grace the nameless

Were I not so weak, could I even speak

It's like I got the 4-4 cocked
On the block in it two door dropped
And my spot is keepin' but hot
The pussy-ass cop throw some murder in the lot
My nigga got popped with a bullet that was meant for me
The adapt by T's and B's and the regencies
Fuck what the reason be, I'ma start squeezin these
Them niggas ain't G's, they wanna be thugs
And it ain't shit, these ain't no motherfuckin slugs
The fools and plugged plus ain't no hoes over here
I done dropped more dead bodies than tears
Brought to life momma's worst fears
Pictures of a son dyin' from that hot ones flyin
Baby mama's cryin at the funeral
Cause the magnum lit him like a Black and Mild
When I rolled out on his ass on the solo
I caught him up on mo-mo cookin up co-co
I got to tip on the low-low
Bust it there like po-po takin' lives with the, oh no
It's a 4-4, mini-missile with a silencer for the whistle
My favorite pistol, 'cause when I let that bitch ride
I know the homicide is being carried out in official
Niggas steady bumpin guns, but don't want none
Because of these hot ones that explode on contact
A manic that's prepared to die in combat
Besides all that a 4-4 keeps me laced, don't be petty to say
I can see the fear in your face
As I reach my waist for this warm embrace

I got plenty love for the 4-4
But when I pick it up, I don't wanna let it go
Because a nigga straight lovin' your warm embrace
I got plenty love for the 4-5
But when I pick it up, I don't wanna let it ride
But still I bust 'cause I survive from your warm embrace
I got plenty love for the nine-mill
And when I pick it up, I don't really wanna kill
But still I bust because I'm needin' your warm embrace
All you muthafuckas better duck and hide
Before I let it ride, the sucka stepped aside
Still I bust because I'm lovin' your warm embrace

(Mayz)
I love the element of surprise when I'm taking these hoes lives
With my customized 4-5
Get enough ammunition to knock off you, your crew and some more guys
You muthafuckas better get wise
Make sure your first shot is sweet, tryin' to kill the elite
Cause you ain't gettin' no more tries
Hate to make a nubian mother weap, but fuck it
Long as I don't hear the hoe cry
Split a beam between his eyes and make that bitch nigga so wise
No matter what the size of the warm embrace of my forty-five
Make sure the nigga crossed through dies
You don't wanna throw them thangs
'Cause when I cocked and aim it's time to think in a split second time
But Mayz ain't new to the game
I use the spark when the shots light up this thunderin crime
But niggas get bucked for dime and it's like you're a magnet for sin
Punk pretend to be your friend till they get close enough to your ends
To do you in, that shit puts me on ten
And make me wanna put the barrel of this solid fiend
Upon under that nigga's chin, plus he talkin' big shit about war
Like he don't know my Speedknot Mob gon' win
But I dare one of you niggas to say my name
'Cause I put a fuckin' bullet into your closest kin
Just to get under your skin like a dirty syringe
Plus I know you can't win with a gun or a pin
So when you see Mayz come in the place you better say your grace
Before I fuck up your face like a can of mace
Before I get disgraced, I'ma catch a case
Maybe you hoes fear the wrath of my warm embrace

(Twista)
With you my passion, nina squeeze off seventeen, for sure
Hold you ever so tightly, I love you nina and never wanna let you go
Miss Millimeter's makin' a mockery of motherfuckers gotsta be ruckus
When I get my clutches upon this hoe
Itchin' to let the barrel blow
Like a sparrow, how it flow, like an arrow, geronimo
Spit 'em up and swallow slow
I reload, clippin' your ass crack, you constantly blast back
Payback from flashback, some bitches know
Bust till I see the chrome from the intro
You was fucked from the phasin', deep with the cuts and abrasion
Erupts and amazin', nigga, my nina bucked
Fuck the gazin and enemies get tore up from the blazin'
Fool you be burnin' them with your black ass
Murderous hips, hurtin' the grips, ride on personal list
Deposition die for servin' them six
Everyone of 'em with a hit but some are missin' of a jerk to the kick
'Cause I be working my bitch
Tryin' to pimp her but she a wild and a tame thang
Kick a static on when she gangbang, blast in the fullest moon
Niggas better pull it soon or else suffer hellafied bullet wounds
And even though I stay clubbed with some thugs, why call 'em stug
When it comes to her love, it's none above she drawin blood
Static under the bra 'cause every time I take a hit at the bud
And give you a hug you gon' pop up a slug
Drinkin' remy on the block, gotta bust the glock
When the henny hit the chest, bustin' smith-n-wess
Fuck the discussion, I'm bustin' 'em all, clutchin' my balls
If I see y'all be laid to rest, let me hit the sess
Loose revolver used to be a problem solver
But the nina made me a baller
No strap could take the place of the black nine
Leave 'em flat lines, feelin' fury, you was born to taste
From my warm embrace

I got plenty love for the 4-4, 4-4, 4-4
Warm embrace
I got plenty love for the 4-5 (4-5), 4-5 (4-5), 4-5
Warm embrace
I got plenty love for the nine-mill (Nine-mill), nine-mill"

(Gift of Gab)
We'd like to welcome you all again to the world of vibrations
Introduction to the nation of revolutionary thoughts
Hear the sound evolve, expand, and change
Most of the things that we're sayin' haven't broken through your chatter
So y'all niggaz still ego trip based and
Have not begun to taste the kundalini wisdom bliss
I'm droppin' as a lyric quotin' vessel for the stages
Play this on your play list
I like dough
But musically I'm transcendin' the physical
And don't blame me for the slang and the words
God writes these rhymes through me
I just listen to him
I'm just livin' duke
Matrix driven rules haven't fooled me
'Cause I still think abstract
And stay metaphysical
And challenge what is really real
And keep creatin' with the force to bring rap back
Not that it's away
But everybody got somethin' to say
So let me speak the opposite of what's hot now
And make that hot
So it will get exploited
And the corporation only will back dudes who bite my style
And they can try and try again
I've been influenced by a lot of pioneers
South to the East and West
But when a hot MC
Gets on stage with a real MC
Most of the time the situation gets hostile

(Chorus: Ledisi)
We vibrate at higher frequencies
Welcome to our world and intro to
Fall into a space
Where there is no thoughts
Just moments captured
Here we go

We vibrate at higher frequencies
Let us up inside your head
Just step inside our world of vibration
Bump this from your birth to your deathbed

(Gift of Gab)
Take time with the pad and the pen to dig within
In a world of BS that we're livin' in
To my ears music sound sweet as cinnamon
So I stay poundin' out tunes and tunes again and again
In the 5th chapter ladies and gentlemen
And I still got MCs on my dinner menu
Write late at night this isn't David Letterman though
On second thought, I'm like a letter man though
Let the craft evolve catch a little syndrome
Shootin' through your vains, vibratin' though your eardrums
Used to think 30 years old then the end comes
Now I feel like I'm just gainin' momentum
Seen the world two times all except for India
About to vacate there when we finish this one
Work hard but still some sweep
We won't mention them
In fact, they act as fuel for our engine
Engine engine number 9, mic lynchin'
When we're done with this these songs are our pension
MCs are puppets, Me, I'm Jim Henson
Take a squat or get chopped by the henchmen
City, town, state arena or convention
Please believe these the G's that ease pension
Rakka and Ev said that it's a marathon
Song after song, we keep on inventin'

[Chorus] - repeats"

I'm orbiting some random place that I haven't seen for years.
I'm darting around on a path of Brownian mystery.
I can't tell what's the ground or what's the sky or what's in between!

I've been away for so long that I've ended up right back home,
Amongst the family galaxy of nothing that stays the same.
I'm in the family galaxy and we only have one rule:
Keep changing every day, don't stay the same or you'll be a fool!
The family galaxy keeps changing no matter what you do.
We don't know who we are, but we will always be here for you!

Go nowhere, watch the world unfolding day by day,
Each time in a different way.
We'll swim in the sea of change-
Rearrange!
We don't mind where the question leads us.
We know nowhere is better than everywhere.
We have only one answer:
We don't care.
Family galaxy's always there for you and me,
Just like a listening tree,
Come and play in the suns,
They're all ours.
Family galaxy wants you to come and play, and change every day
Come and play in the stars,
They're all ours.

Messier than canvas's by Jackson Pollock
Throwing multicolored thoughts at a rapid pace
I make a mess you dissect it and make sense of it
Then get back to me at your earliest convenience
Check my verbal sequence as I texturize these tracks
Seven layers to be exact eliminate the whack
With a firm brush stroke I MC paintily
Lyricists begin crumbling from my stumbling technique
As I tweak your audio and visual keep my drips minimal messages subliminal
Cause me and rap go way back we compliment
So together we enhance one another that's common sense
High intensity catches the eye your jaw drops
Be a real critic not explicit with false props
I keep my darks deep my lights bright I'm very thorough
With my chiaroscuro inspiration spark and a knife
Now watch me rock the spot like ? minus the heroin
And make my face popular like Andy did to Marilyn
Its kinda scary when real art gets left behind
While they take bullshit and start sellin' it to blind folks
But I remain humble as long as ? continues spinnin' hot shit
On his twin twelve-hundred color wheels of steel
Fuck mass appeal art is art only the real can truly feel it
So open your eyes and listen
Combine your ears with vision
Or do it cause you love it
Or for cash that's your decision
That's your decision
That's your decision

It's like I'm torn between two worlds
A paintbrush and a microphone
A canvas or a beat
CD or LP
Anything goes when my ink pen flows
And God only knows where it's gonna bring me next
So I'm inclined to like paint rhymes and spit kaleidoscopes with one eye closed
And I suppose if you chose the path that I chose
You know the cycle ass ho don't front
It goes inspiration and productivity then a sense of self worth and in steps depression
Like back and forth and forth and back
Should I paint a picture or record a track
A gift or a curse I don't know I'm still undecided
But over the years I've found clever ways to hide it
And those that lack the passion I have may despise it
But my momma made me this way I thank her everyday
So tell them kids to keep coloring outside the lines
Until they lose they limitations and they minds is free
Tell them teachers that you want your money back this time
And tell Bob Ross thanks for all the happy little trees
And tell my momma that her baby boy is doing just fine
Although hes running out of patience but his mind is free
And tell my pops that I'll pay his money back sometime
And that his son is two steps away from where he needs to be"

You were thinking I was sleeping in my thoughts
So lonely my tears fall down my brain
Rode my train for a cheap price, baby it's no surprise

Looking down from your high horse
Listening to my lullaby
I was thinking, that the world of sin
A sinking feeling, like I'm falling in love again

Looking down from your high horses
Like I didn't matter, of course
Say hello at my funeral
I'll be right there on time

You could only be my love
Dated like the stars above
You could only be my love, love, love"

Hey yo, turn the beat up a little bit
Hey yo, this song is for anyone... fuck it, just shut up and listen
Hey yo

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences gettin' this stress
That's been eatin' me recently off of this chest

And I rest again peacefully (peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter

To not come and speak to me (speak to me)
I don't know you and no, I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-ing thing
I'm not Mr. *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick

If you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet (10 feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you

Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of arguin' (of arguin)
I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be, it's just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content.
That song ""Guilty Conscience"" has gotten such rotten responses.""

And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinky

Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school

And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see an upper class city

Havin' this happenin' (this happenin' )
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name Is""

And pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
That copped me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)
To deal with these cocky caucasians

Who think, I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?

The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
Till I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (ahhh)
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (me crazy)
I can't take it, I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am

Coming out soft from the windows above
Just when you have had enough

And you will forgive her
Lay me down beside the water

Sun comes up each day to chase away the moon
Even the stars at night they fade away too soon
You can't do much about the trouble life brings
Cut all the lines so the phones don't ring
But stay here once from spring to spring
Watching the ice melt the mornings sing

Raising strong and mighty fortresses that I alone command
But these castles I've constructed by the strength of my own hand
Are just temporary kingdoms on foundations made of sand

In the middle of the battle I believe I've finally found
I'll never know the thrill of victory till I'm willing to lay down
All my weapons of defense and earthly strategies of war
So I'm laying down my arms and running helplessly to Yours

I surrender all my silent hopes and dreams
Though the price to follow costs me everything
I surrender all my human soul desires
If sacrifice requires
That all my kingdoms fall
I surrender all

If the source of my ambition is the treasure I obtain
If I measure my successes on a scale of earthly gain
If the focus of my vision is the status I attain
My accomplishments are worthless and my efforts are in vain

So I lay aside these trophies to pursue a higher crown
And should You choose somehow to use the life I willingly lay
Down
I surrender all the triumph for it's only by Your grace
I relinquish all the glory, I surrender all the praise

Everything I am, all I've done, and all I've known
Now belongs to You, the life I live is not my own
Just as Abraham laid Isaac on the sacrificial fire
If all I have is all that You desire
I surrender all"

She is dynamite

But I refuse to light the fuse I walk on by

Stronger I no longer call her name

I'm over her somehow

She's the flame I use to fly into

But she can't burn me now



She can't burn me now, I'm fireproof

She can't burn me now, I know

She can't burn me now, she can't touch me

She can't burn me now, I know



She's the circumstance that turned romance into a bad soap opera scene

I'm the clown who tried to move uptown, caught up in his own dream

I came down so hard, caught off guard, she hurt me bad I will allow

But I'm back on my feet, the cure complete, she can't burn me now

Whose useful days were gone and passed
He told me in a cardboard tone
How long ago he once had flown

When I was young he did relate
I'd watch the birds as they'd escape
From the greedy ground we grovelled on
Into the clouds and then beyond...

What kind of bird am I?
How can I learn to fly?

And so each day I'd try, he said
To let go of my mind of led
And with my body floating free
Swim in the air as in the sea

This was my greatest, strongest wish
And so the air did not resist
One day above the ground I rose
And felt the air beneath my toes

What kind of boy am I?
How can I learn to fly?

I rose above the tallest trees
And summersalted in the breeze
I dove with lightning speed and then
I shot up to the clouds again

I jumped off buildings with delight
And laughed at those afraid of heights
What need has anyone for fear
When we are free and the sky is near?

Oh, what a boy was I?
When do we learn to die?

And when I saw I was alone
And no one close to me would come
I soon forgot the joy of sky
And gently back to earth came I

I've never flown again, said he
Because we're all alike, you see
Our sickness strengthens unity
And no one needs to question me

Este amor es
la mejor cara del poder
y est√°s cansada de poner
el dedo en la llaga

Este tiempo lleg√≥ para ahogar
a la bestia
todo acaba bloqueado
entre tanta histeria

Hoy hagamos la excepci√≥n de romper las reglas
tanto hambre sin satisfacci√≥n, satisfacci√≥n
Hoy hagamos la excepci√≥n de estirar la cuerda
y que durar sea mejor que arder, mejor que arder

(Nena ll√©vame a alg√∫n lugar con parlantes)
(Vas a ver)

Mecanismos de ilusi√≥n
todo el mundo nena, es impostor

Hoy hagamos la excepci√≥n de romper las reglas
tanto hambre sin satisfacci√≥n, satisfacci√≥n
hoy hagamos la excepci√≥n de estirar la cuerda
y que durar sea mejor que arder, mejor que arder

Ya romp√≠ las reglas"

Comme un saligaud

Mon alter ego
On √©tait du m√™me bois
Un peu rustique un peu brute
Dont on fait n'importe quoi
Sauf naturell'ment les fl√ªtes
J'ai maint'nant des fr√™nes
Des arbres de jud√©e
Tous de bonne graine
De haute futaie
Mais toi tu manques √† l'appel
Ma vieille branche de campagne
Mon seul arbre de No√´l
Mon m√¢t de cocagne.

Aupr√®s de mon arbre,
Je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais d√ª m'√©loigner d'mon arbre
Aupr√®s de mon arbre,

Je suis un pauvre type
J'aurai plus de joie
J'ai jet√© ma pipe
Ma vieille pipe en bois
Qui avait fum√© sans s'f√¢cher
Sans jamais m'br√ªler la lippe
L'tabac d'la vache enrag√©e
Dans sa bonne vieille t√™te de pipe
J'ai des pipes d'√©cume
Orn√©es de fleurons
De ces pipes qu'on fume
En levant le front
Mais j'retrouv'rai plus ma foi
Dans mon c≈ìur ni sur ma lippe

Le surnom d'inf√¢me
Me va comme un gant
D'avecque ma femme
J'ai foutu le camp
Parce que depuis tant d'ann√©es
C'√©tait pas une sin√©cure
De lui voir tout l'temps le nez
Au milieu de la figure
Je bas la campagne
Pour d√©nicher la
Nouvelle compagne
Valant celle-l√†
Qui, bien s√ªr, laissait beaucoup
Trop de pierres dans les lentilles
Mais se pendait √† mon cou
Quand j'perdais mes billes.

Aupr√®s de mon arbre,
Je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais d√ª m'√©loigner d'mon arbre
Aupr√®s de mon arbre,
Je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais d√ª le quitter des yeux.

J'avais une mansarde
Pour tout logement
Avec des l√©zardes
Sur le firmament
Je l'savais par c≈ìur depuis
Et pour un baiser la course
J'emmenais mes belles de nuits
Faire un tour sur la grande ourse
J'habite plus d'mansarde
Il peut d√©sormais
Tomber des hallebardes
Je m'en bats l'≈ìil mais,
Mais si quelqu'un monte aux cieux
Moins que moi j'y paie des prunes
Y'a cent sept ans, qui dit mieux,
Qu'j'ai pas vu la lune!

Aupr√®s de mon arbre,
Je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais d√ª m'√©loigner d'mon arbre
Aupr√®s de mon arbre,
Je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais d√ª le quitter des yeux."

Can you feel the ground move 'round your feet
If you take one step closer, it'll lead to another
The crossroad above is where we meet
I shout out for shelter, I need you for something
The whole world is out, they're all on the street
Control yourself, love is all you need
Control yourself, in your eyes
Sanctify yourself, sanctify
Be apart of me, sanctify
Sanctify yourself, sanctify
Sanctify yourself, set yourself free

In pictures of living, in bloodshot a vision
Sweet miracles and strange circumstances
I see the sun up, the showdown, the cool winds that blow down
On the big beat that life-long romance is
You've got a gun in your hand, you're making self plans
Stay with me all through the night
Control yourself, love is all you need
Control yourself, open up your heart
Sanctify yourself, sanctify
Be apart of me, sanctify
Sanctify yourself, sanctify
Sanctify yourself, set yourself free

You can't stop the world for a boy or a girl
Sweet victims of poor circumstances
But you can pour back the love, sweeping down from above
Giving hope and making more chances
Well, I hope and I pray that maybe someday
You'll come back down here and show me the way
Control yourself, love is all you need
Control yourself, open up your heart
Open up your heart
Sanctify yourself, sanctify
Sanctify yourself, sanctify
Sanctify yourself, set yourself free"

And you feel like dancing
And you feel like shining
And you feel like letting loose 

What ya gonna be?
Babe, you better know
And you better plan
Better plan all day

Better plan all week, better plan all month
Better plan all year

You're dressed up like a clown
Putting on your act
It's the only time all year
You'll ever admit that

I can see your eyes, I can see your brain
Baby, nothing's changed
I can see your eyes, I can see your brain
Baby, nothing's changed

Because you're hiding in a mask
You take your fun seriously
No, don't blow this year's chance
Tomorrow your mold goes back on

After Halloween 
After Halloween

You go to work today
You'll go to work tomorrow
Shitfaced tonight
You'll brag about it for months

Remember what I did, remember what I was
Back on Halloween?

But what's in between?
Where are your ideas?
You sit around and dream
For next Halloween

Why not every day, are you so afraid
What will people say?
Why not every day, are you so afraid
What will people say?

After Halloween
After Halloween
After Halloween

Because your role is planned for you
There's nothing you can do
But stop and think it through

But what will the boss say to you?
And what will your girlfriend say to you?
And the people out on the street, they might glare at you
And what do you know, you're pretty self-conscious too 

So you run back and stuff yourselves in rigid business costumes
Only at night to score is your leather uniform exhumed
Why don't you take your social regulations and shove 'em up your ass?
Why don't you take your social regulations and shove 'em up your ass?

Why don't you take your social regulations and shove 'em up your ass?"

The choice is yours but you said choose
The look she used was green and sharp
Stabbed that boy all in his heart
Come what may, the cosmos will
Take me up and down on Primirose Hill

Lost moments get impaled my presence fades away
Oblivious surface obscures my eyes
Strong with the desire of hate
As reality and vision united
Communion enlarge my darkness
With multitude of light
The still uncolored circle of seven senses
The visionary wheel of drifting desired shadows

Affections of remained rites
Filled by perfumes of past destination
A distant chaos far beyond
From what our eyes can see
The superhuman side within
A mixed movement of a demolished world

Unlocked narration of key elements
Creates the wall of past and future passing
Let's all wounds be now against our bodies
Release fantasy before the eyes
Runs sudden to the depth of subconscious

Decentness sun of night releases my fate
Half wayside of life and emptiness
Upland in distant night of galaxies
Glass awake the symbol of passage
Reflection demands the quest of existence

Kept upon illusions of fancy gateway
The sound of silence pours my body
Underground pyramid of blood
Creations and destructions of century bone"

Scarred for your trespass

And quit before you sweat a drop 
Feed your empty brain 
With your hydroponic pot 
Start out playing with yourself 
You get more fun within your shell 
Nice to meet you but I gotta go my way 

I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain 
But you're so in love with yourself 
If I say my heart is sore 
Sounds like a cheap metaphor 
So I won't repeat it no more 

I rather eat my soup with a fork 
Or drive a cab in New York 
'Cause to talk to you is harder work 

So what's the point of wasting all my words 
If it's just the same or even worse 
Than reading poems to a horse 

You keep on aiming for the top 
And quit before you sweat a drop 
Feed your empty brain 
With your hydroponic pot 
I bet you'll find someone like you 
'Cause there's a foot for every shoe 
And I wish you luck but I've other things to do

Saw my wife sleeping alone
She whispered, ""Baby, are you OK? Have you been gone for long?""

I held her all night long

Life's fairy tale
You've almost reached your end
No, you can't complain
You've got so many friends
You bet they stand by you
Course you've got some faith
...And hope
Constitute your backbone

Base life on solid ground
Trust in your future
By just a simple count

You thought you're footloose
And fancy free
Enjoy your freedom
Nothing lasts forever
You should have known
Just dreams stick for a lifetime

Envy and jealousy
Rips your destiny
Who you believe a word
And... of life
'Cause you've no idead
How mean this world could be

As long as you're respected
People kissing your feet
But faster that you expected
They'll make you bleed
Trapped in reality
They'll lead you from your destiny
Trapped in a tragedy
Trapped in reality
They'll lead you from your destiny
Trapped in a tragedy
Trapped in reality
Trapped in a tragedy
Trapped in reality
Trapped in a tragedy

Watch the signals behind your back
Cut them with your knife
Everything will fade away
They melt into the void

The unions... you made
You have done your job
They will throw you away
They'll go to their decline"

And the time is passing you by is a lonely time and you want to fly
Call on me, call on me 
Call on me, call on me 
I'll be by your side

When you turn around, needing somebody there
Who can give you love and show you good care
If there's a place inside you that's empty and cold
You may need my love, to have, to hold
Call on me, call on me 
Call on me, call on me 
I'll be by your side
To keep you satisfied

I want to keep you satisfied

Call on me, call on me 
Call on me, call on me 
I'll be by your side
To keep you satisfied

When the clear light of a winter's day
Blows cold and hard and the future is grey
You can always have the fire of love
To keep you warm as the sun above
Call on me, call on me 
Call on me, call on me 
I'll be by your side
To keep you satisfied
I'll be by your side
To keep you satisfied

Don't worry about the rain, baby
I'll keep you dry
I'll keep you warm inside
And satisfied

I used to go my perfect way
I used to laugh at my mistakes
Few as they were
But not today
Now I'm wiping off my grin
A widow's spider's web I'm in
There's none so blind as he who sees
With hindsight
Twenty twenty

You think you know it all
But there's always something more

You're exactly what I needed
But how was I to know
Now that I've discovered it
I have to let it go
Exactly what I needed
So tell me what was wrong
Something so intangible
You never really miss it till its
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone

This bed of roses that I'm in
Turns out as only thorns and stems
I used to recognize this place
For what it's worth
But not today
It wasn't all that long ago
When I was perfect on my own
I used to thrive on my mistakes
Few as they were
But that has changed

Everything I knew
An illusion to me know

I used to wake up everyday
I used to go my perfect way
I used to dream of my mistakes
Few as they were
But not today

A season that lasts through all changes in time
I try so hard sometimes
I wish there was a raincheck on tomorrow
Not ready to deal with what I don't wanna find

Struggling on, just to hold on
I just wanna know, why is it me?

In a tear there is a message from the heart
Detached from the good, it's the hope gone astray
I cry so hard sometimes
Too scared to think of what will bring tomorrow
Already much more than I can handle today

I can't breathe, suffocate as I'm buried by hate
And so sadly I learn, there's no justice to fate
I just wanna know why is it me?
Losing the race with thoughts out of place
I just wanna, know why is it me?

You ain't got a monopoly on sorrow
You know plenty has made it my way
You ain't got a monopoly on sorrow
There's plenty that feel just the same

There's a pain so insane that I fight but can't tame
And my mind battles on as my body lies lame

I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts
I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts
I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts
I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts
Hurts, hurts

And I know that I know I don't know that I know
It just would stay clear then I'd see and I'd go
I just wanna know, why's it me?
Ain't got a monopoly on sorrow

You, you
You ain't got no no, you ain't got no no
You ain't got no no, you ain't got no no
There's no monopoly on sorrow
No monopoly on sorrow
No monopoly on sorrow
No no no no

Every night of the week
It's gonna be my fault,

If everything goes wrong
When I'm singing my song
It's gonna be my fault

Will I remain the same
The cost of getting forced
Into something that
Used to be a game
The fragments of joy
The fragments of faith
I can still recall
When I feel that
I'm present, I just know
If there's anything
I should regret
I would've been told
Counting hours
Counting days
Will you listen
Will you play
Is there anyone
Who can get it done?
Taking me back to the place
That I once belonged
What if tomorrow
Was gently taken
Away from me
Away from me

Awaking the memories
Was I meant to get old
Repressing the agonies
Start breaking the mold

And the faith
Comes back to life
Still waiting for
A constant thing to react
But I will save myself 
Some of the time
Keep aiming for
A constant thing to react

As the sleeper awakes

Mesmerized by the memories
That walk by my side
Shelter comes easy
As soon as sadness sets in
By an impulse the search will begin

Searching, collecting
All the things
I possess a detecting
The insight I've
Earned in distress
Learning, finally I know
How to breathe
Turning, turning away
From the greed
So unpleasant
It strikes whenever I call
So relentless
As I fall
A grand awakening
Will kill it all
Nevertheless
I'll be my own precious god
I can't resist
The things I've missed
And I'll make sure that it
Will last the time
I will insist
What if tomorrow
Was taken away from me
Away from me
Away from me

Awaking the memories
Was I meant to get old
Repressing the agonies
Start breaking the mold

And the faith
Comes back to life
Still waiting for

Let's just pray it's not near

Stay forever; I won't last it
I'll die trying
Will you suffer a little with me?
But you would never

With a second chance I'd mess it up again
But I'd do it worse than before
'Cause I've learned so much more

About the way we fertilise the roses
That were bought to show us how much you care
Now it's easier to care

Getting past this -- you have to take it
I will wait here

Say you'll get help

When I was only nine or ten
I‚Äôd run trot lines in the muddy water
I‚Äôd watch the leaves riding the wind

It was there I smoked my first Marlboro
It was there I kissed Laurie Jones
I‚Äôd lie in the tall grass for hours
I‚Äôd walk in the shallows, I‚Äôd skim those stones

And one day I was climbing in the railroad trestle
I heard the sound of a coming train
Man it was on me like a rolling thunder
Lit a fear inside I can‚Äôt explain

Sent me running, sent me screaming
Like a wild man through the tall grass
Trying to make it back home

And it was then I ran into that stranger
With his suitcase and his walking cane
He put his hand on my little shoulder
And since that day I ain‚Äôt been the same

He sends me running, sends me screaming
Down a freeway, down a runway
Trying to make it back home

And here I stand in this darkened hallway
My babies sleeping, dreaming soft and low
I feel his hand on my shoulder
Like that day down down by the Mill Creek long ago"

No questions
I pledge resistance to the grass
That hides the snakes of America
So they watch it, now I walk with caution
More careful put more thought to options
Is the opposite of progress Congress?
From the school to the street we're beyond stress
But I fight for peace, that's what the problem is
War is big biz, ask an economist
Speak in volumes callin' anti-war and anti-American synonymous
Back in the day I would've gotten black listed just for speakin' up
Hoover probably would've screamed Communist!
I want black and brown unity
But cats get out to bring the jail to the community
Fightin's nothin' new to me
I even corrected what the public school system tried to do to me
Here's a spark encoded in rhyme and love for everyone of the devoted in line...
We call it art, some call it a crime
It's the rap Michael Moore, like Bowling for Columbine
On drums, Fahrenheit, 9-1-1
Al Queda hit the Apple and the world was stunned
The villain trained by the hero for the killing
Now you twist $20 bills to see buildings
Under heavy surveillance
They might call you a traitor if you want something greater
Don't get me wrong, America's a great place to live
Just listen to the knowledge I give
If more than half the budget goes to military spending
Less than half goes to whatever it's defending
One nation, many gods, individuals with liberties
And justice for all who are miserable

Because I'm sick and tired of all this ice and snow

When I get back to Memphis, you can bet I'll stay
When I get back to Memphis, you can bet I'll stay
And I ain't gonna leave until the judgment day

I love old Memphis, the place where I was born. (Sure do love it, boy)
I love old Memphis, the place where I was born
Wear my box-back suit and drink my fine old corn

(Ah, if I just had railroad fare! It would be tight like that)
(That would give you the breaks)
(Don't want no breaks. I want a freight)

I wrote my gal a letter way down in Tennessee. (Ah, today)
I wrote my gal a letter way down in Tennessee
Told her I was up here hungry, hurry up and send for me

I'm gonna walk and walk till I walk out all my shoes. (You'll be walking some)

Because I got what they call them leaving-here blues

You even let her drive your car
She wears your ring, you treat her oh so fine
But you're telling me that I'm the one that's on your mind

When she took a walk to the ladies room
You didn't hesistate to run to me
I don't wanna be caught in the middle of you
But your charm keeps gettin' the best of me

Curiosity

When you get home out of the socialite
You call me with the same excuse
I get upet, but you talk so smooth
Got me running round in circles feeling so confused

She's leaving home again
Maybe this time she'll be strong enough
Tears fill up her eyes
As her kids wave their goodbyes
Maybe this time they'll be strong enough
Finally its fare-thee-well
Thirty three, she's been through hell
It's time to ramble on
She takes off all her clothes
The petals stripped off of a rose
The pain is finally gone
And somewhere way up in the night
The moon reflects a brilliant light
And she smiles because she knows that she is free


A lonely man shaving in the sink
As he slowly sips his drink
He remembers how he used to be
The numbness in his soul runs deep
Blacker and blacker, week by week
He remembers how things used to be
His kids are grown, his wife's long gone
He stumbles home then drinks till dawn
He won't escape today
He drops his shoes onto the floor
Can't fight these demons anymore
He finally falls asleep
And somewhere way up in the night
The moon reflects a brilliant light
And he cries because he knows he can't be free"

Snuck up behind me and jumped on my shopping cart
And rolled down aisle five
You looked behind you to smile back at me
Crashed into a rack full of magazines
They asked us if we could leave

Can't remember what went wrong last September
Though I'm sure you'd remind me if you had to

Our love was comfortable and so broken in

I sleep with this new girl I'm still getting used to
My friends all approve, say ""she's gonna be good for you""
They throw me high fives
She says the Bible is all that she reads
And prefers that I not use profanity
Your mouth was so dirty

Life of the party and she swears that she's artsy
But you could distinguish Miles from Coltrane

Our love was comfortable and so broken in
She's perfect
So flawless
Or so they say, hey
Say, hey

She thinks I can't see the smile that she's faking
And poses for pictures that aren't being taken
I loved you
Grey sweatpants
No makeup
So perfect

Our love was comfortable and so broken in
She's perfect
So flawless
I'm not impressed
I want you back"

We shake the tall trees till the leaves drop round our ears
Swimming the cold water where the sun will never shine
Making preparations for the whip-crack time
Hauling the Kraken up with blocks and chains -
We're sailing into the eyes of hurricanes
You know that no one here gets out alive
Only one thing makes it when the Devil drives:

We're gonna steel up the flesh to the fire
You gonna find out what the rules are then
Well sister, sister, won't you pray for me -
We're going running on the rocks again...

Flaming amazement - madder than the gale
Wreathed in shadows; crackling in the sails
This is our mission now as then -
We can do no other here we stand: Amen
The winds are crying - remember me
Through the holy silence of the desert and the sea
The next Armada waiting for the tide
Wind and rain are nothing to the storm inside

We're gonna steel up the flesh to the fire
You gonna find out what the rules are then
Well sister, sister, won't you pray for me -
We're going running on the rocks again...

We're gonna steel up the flesh to the fire
You gonna find out what the rules are then
Well sister, sister, won't you pray for me -

To the hip hip-hop, and you don't stop the rock
First you rock the hip and then you rock the hop
Then you hippie the hop and don't stop
Going on and on and on and on
Like hot butter on say what the popcorn
Gonna rock the beat to the break of dawn
Gonna party, party, party till you're all going home

This is the way we used to rhyme
These are the rhymes that we used to say
This is the way we used to sound
Way, way back in the day

Clap your hands and stomp your feet
And rock to the rhythm of the funky beat
Stomp your feet and clap your hands
'Cause I am the man with the master plan
Going back and forth and forth and back
Three words for the wack's: stay the hell back
If the wack may attack keep the wack back
This drum machine is guaranteed to cause a heart attack
Going up to the ceiling, down to the floor
Bounce around the balls and back out the door
Tried to come back in cause you want more
Those funky rhymes galore

This is the way we used to rhyme
These are the rhymes that we used to say
This is the way we used to sound
Way, way back in the day

Pepper to the salt, salt to the pepper
Don't come to the party if you're a half-stepper
Salt to the pepper, pepper to the salt
If you can't rock to this it ain't my fault
A lime to a lemon, a lemon to a lime
I rock the rhyme in half the time
From a lemon to a lime, a lime to a lemon

Put your feet on the rhythm, put your feet on the rock
Put your feet on the rock
Put your feet on the rhythm, put your feet on the rock

I'm giving you a taste of the disco slice
Like 4-5-6 on Cee-lo Dice
And I get more sex than a cat chase mice
Rock and roll, and roll and rock
Let's rock to the rhythm of the rock, rock, rock
And roll and rhyme, and rock and roll
Come on, party people, let's get out of control
Now the people in the back and not the wack
To the people on the side, let's ride
To the people in the middle let me see you wiggle
And people on the top, don't stop
Jump up, jump up
Just like a disco duck
Go down, go down
Just like a disco clown
Go on, go on
To, to the break of dawn
Jump back, jump back
And I can rock it like this 'cause I got it like that
Now do it, do it, do, do, do it
Do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do, do, do it
Do, do it, do it
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if y'all wanna rock the house tonight
Somebody say ""oh yeah"" (oh yeah)
Oh yeah (oh yeah)
Now I hear ya
Now I hear ya, hear ya, hear ya, hear ya, hear ya

I can't find what I'm missing
I've lost myself I hope that you're listening
I've seen my puzzle taken apart
It's hard to start again

But with you, all I knew was the filth that you put me through

I'm sick reliving the past
My time it came and it passed
I'm holding on to the memories, making them last
So when you come around
You'll find me on the ground
Searching for a piece that I never found

And I knew it was to be

Way it's gonna  

Lately I find I'm caught up in these thoughts 
How will you come to me 
How will we connect these hearts 
Are you somewhere near 
Hidden like a four-leaf clover 
Are you miles away 
Are we getting any closer 
Are we getting any closer  

I already see us moving mountains 
I already see us walking water 
I already see the clouds we're flying 
Over and under 
I already see us having babies 
Walking through the park and being lazy 
I already see myself falling in love eternally 
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be 
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be  

I already see us moving mountains 
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be 
I already see us walking water 
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be  

Being with you 
Is a like a scene from a dream in heaven 
I feel you running through 
All my senses 
Will you taste like rain 
Can I breathe you like air 
Will I lose myself in your arms somewhere  

I already see us moving mountains 
I already see us walking water 
I already see the clouds we're flying 
Over and under 
I can really see us having babies 
Walking through the park and being lazy 
I already see myself falling in love eternally 
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be 
I think that's just the way it's gonna be  

And I know and I know and I know 
Love can move a mountain 
And I know and I know 
It's gonna be even better than I imagined 
Putting all my trust in you 
Putting all my trust in you 
We'll make this dream come true  

I can really see us having babies 
Walking through the park and being lazy 
I already see myself falling in love eternally 
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be 
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be  

I already see us moving mountains 
The way it's gonna be 
I already see us walking water 
The way it's gonna be 
I can really see us having babies 
The way it's gonna be 
I already see myself falling in love  
Meant to be 
I already see us moving mountains 
The way it's gonna be  
I already see us walking water 
To me 
The way it's gonna be 
I can really see us having babies
The way it's gonna be"

We limelighters. Up until the ugly unplug me. We limelighters. Kill it now, fade to black comfortably. Spark the dynamite 'til the limelight's gone. As far as I can see the limelight stays on. And on and on and on the limelight... so we got something built if we all die tonight.

SUEDE- Wave that colt 44, bolts of lightning with Travolta grease. Strip your skeleton, it's swelterin' inside Miami Heat. Your fishnet and red vette are sizzling. Shoot through chocolate city, Wonder Woman wind whisting. Freeze, presidential sleaze, with Egyptian cuts, Valentine Ave., Jack Daniels out of them plastic cups. Winter white pinstripe lookin' Hugo. Poison ivy out the windpipe blowin' the crucial.

And we're all in this together, don't you know

Aggression rears its ugly head
Retaliation brings further dread
The two are linked by unseen threads
That wind back through time

Nationalism is an evil friend
But hatred is instilled by invisible lines
Drawn in our minds

Oh serena. I know what they're saying about you.

You tasted death, but, ill shed the night, night irreverant all

Time to feel it, time to fix it. time to lure it, oh
No time to miss it, time to lure this stone cold

Huh, you tell me baby.

Saafir:Hey, it's like this man.
I gotta let these motherfuckers know how to crawl man.

I know everybody tryin' to come up immediately.

Saafir:You know they don't got the motherfuckin' perseverance 'cause they
Ain't have it hold up though. I gotta go and do this man.

You can hear the ambition mobbin' in my po position
The intention is to come up
Do your grindin' pay the boss before you floss
And don't lose your mind and find discipline'
And stackin' your scratch
So it don't come up missin' in
As you're askin' the Lord for guidance
While you ridin'
Stickin' and movin' slidin'
In and out the game
Unless you realize you're sprung before you legalize your funds
All you track hustlers that was made for the corner
Dodgin' the coroner's office
I'm tossin' this at you
Now on some sermon type shit
I'm burnin' and I gotta write this
The mic got me ballin'
Shot callin'
It's the murk one like that
Sit back but not in starship
So I don't tarnish or rust
When I'm bustin' on the next jerk
Who swears he's ballin' but can't network
You better off with sexwork
The way you fucked in the game
It's a shame
I'm aimin' at the bathroom stall on all of y'all
With the H.J.s deflecting these hate rays
Until the sun falls
You acquired a dream
Crawl before you ball

What you thought?
You was just gonna ball on the spot?
Let's be real
You gotta stack dollar bills before you get a mil
Gotta handle business before you choose to chill or you fall
Crawl before you ball

All you pompous ass marks in Babylon yawnin'
Becomin' another nigga spawnin'
&gt;From the trenches
The stench is unknown
I've been crawlin' like a two toed
Chameleon for so long
Writing these songs and ridin' these thongs
With bracelets on they ankle bone
That's anxious to moan
Like Neena Samone
Have a trick
Sickin' thinkin'
That we know it's on
You better crawl before you ball man
Before you fall man
Keep ya hoes off your payroll
Unless they crawl with you
And you know they all with you
And even then they won't fall with you
I'm like fuck 'em
I got to
It's a new sheriff in town his name is Reggie Mamoo
Ya hear?
More like Saafir
On a crawl
By watch how daddy ball
I'm all ears and all eyes
Recognize
I'm crawlin'

Baby baby let me kick my all to y'all
You gotta crawl before you ball
I've seen so many many soldiers fall
They didn't know you had to crawl before you ball

You see gotta put in major work in at first
Before you burst
Crawl before you ball but never lose your thirst
When you ballin'
Or you gonna end up broke and butt naked with no garments on
While I'm makin' more cheese than Parmesian
Learn game at a fast rate
Apply it to my walk then stalk
I won't fall off 'cause I'm a put in that work
And I'm a stick to that plan
Now I'm a stay down with my folleys
The team then turn and brace God gave green
Going, going till I'm gone
I'm ballin'"

In a night so dark and silent as in the realms of death

In the streams of nothing going toward eternity
From a world far beyond a world of evil existence they dwell
Within the light of God and await the final resurrection
Born by the rage of torment... fire
The spawn of evil shall defeat the...
Liar demons of the coming judgement
Where they may wonder blood shall follow their path
Driven by the vengeance from an earlier past
Storms of crimson rain is bound to fall,
Repent your sins cause today you die
Chained to life with a fate not knowned

I like to wake up in the morning
And when the truth was told
The'd say Tex never donated nothing
But then ole Tax never stole
I just like to start even, start even that's all

I like to wake up in the morning
And sy there's two things I never done
I ain't never fought with nobody
But then I ain't never run
I just like to start even, start even that's all

I'd like to wake up in the morning
Without a sweetheart or a wife
Or without some little gal hanging around
Saying Tex done ruined her life
Wish I'd never made nobody happy, made nobody sad
Got nobody tickled or made nobody mad
Then I could just start even, start even that's all
And then that's all

Now I never dabbled in high society
Don't reckon I would if I could
I'm a little too good for the bad folks
And a-way too bad for the good
If I don't soon lose my misery

As cute as she can be
Moved in today
Across the way
At number sixty three
And she's made a hit with me

She's got a dog and cat
The cutest little hat
And all the boys just call her ""Baby""
She's got a dainty style
A little baby smile
The kind that makes you wanna stick around awhile

She's got those dreamy eyes
And every time she sighs
You forget your family
Her father's over eighty with his nice grey locks
He's made a million dollars out of bonds and stocks
And she's his only child
And she's just awfully wild
That's the kind of baby for me

She's got a dog and cat
The cutest little hat
And all the boys just call her ""Baby""
She's got a bungalow
Down where the breezes blow
And lots of other little things you shouldn't know

She's got those dreamy eyes
And every time she sighs
You forget your family
I raised a little moustache, cute as any pup
My baby kissed me once and burned the darned thing up
She said, ""It's so much fun
Please raise another one""

And when I saw the cheque I thought it was the rent
But when the waiter came
She simply signed her name

Dame de lo que puedas
O se perder√° para siempre
Todo lo que cay√≥ ardi√≥ dos veces
Sobre m√≠ se abre tu flor de humedad

Buenos Aires, ciudad del sino
Duende de un destino
Ante la luz de tus amores, de tu misterio divino
Hoy no s√©, ma√±ana tal vez, caiga rendido

El tiempo y el agua que tiene hoy este r√≠o
A√∫n no pudo apagar tanto fuego ca√≠do
Vicios de sociedad
Que est√° esperando un milagro
Algunos los que van, otros clavados al barro
Sobre m√≠ se abre tu flor de humedad

Se van juntando almas
S√≠mbolo de un sue√±o que nace
Tantos a√±os de lucha
Por tus rincones y calles
Prisionero fugaz que est√° con vos y con otra
Boca roja de tango que me provoca
Sobre m√≠ se abre tu flor de humedad

Buenos Aires, ciudad del sino
Duende de un destino
Ante la luz de tus amores, de tu misterio divino
Hoy no s√©, ma√±ana tal vez, caiga rendido"

Baut bitte die Twin Towers wieder auf
F√ºrs Video rei√üe ich sie wieder aus

Ich bin ein K√ºnstler, du mein Werk, wenn wir uns duellieren
Ich komm mit Kissen auf die Fete, um die Sch√ºsse zu d√§mpfen
Denn ich bin hier, um die Tapete mit deinem Hirn zu verzieren
W√ºrde er leben, w√§ren wir die Lieblingsband von Charles Manson

Ich komm mit Kettens√§ge, wenn ich euch B√ºrschchen hole

Where my journey leads I do not know.
I just follow my inner voice.
Longer and longer on misty pathways I go.

I travel into an unknown vale.
Through forests over hills and far away.

The chilly breezes of night surrounds me
With their smooth gentle touches.
The fog hides the path
Which I walk upon.

Voices I hear from inside the dark
And dusky the night have laid.
Observed by the forgotten shadowpeople I am
As I wander through their realm.

The silvery cold moon looks upon me.
As I strive through these spellbound forests."

I draw first blood be the first to set it off
My cause, tap all jaws lay down laws
We takin' what's yours we do jerks rush the doors
Here come the deez tryin' to make breeze and guns toss
In full force, my team'll go at your main source
We're not tourists, hit bosses and take hostage
Your whole setup, from the ground up we lock shit
Blood flood your eye, fuck up your optics
Switch to killer instincts for niggaz pop shit
Yo nigga Noyd what's the topic? Nine pound we rocked in
Ninety-six strike back with more hot shit
Illuminate my team'll glow like, radiation
With no time for patient, or complication
Let's get it done right, my click airtight
Trapped in a never ending gunfight so niggaz lose stripes
Or lose life, jail niggaz sendin kites to the street
Over some beef that wasn't fully cooked, finish 'em off
Well done meat, that said twenty-two slug to your head
Travel all the way down to your leg

Chorus: together

Aiyyo it's hell on earth, whose next or gonna be first
The projects is front lines, and the enemy is one time
I ain't gotta tell you
It's right in front of your eyes

We wreck the QBC, nigga rep yours it's all love
Milli stacked down, heavenly guarded by hollow tip slug
Then crack down, on wannabe thugs adapt to gat sound
And bow down, slow the fuck up, see how my foul now
Articulate, hittin body parts to start shiftin shit
Never hesitant, it's the crack game unlimited
Summon rasta we can do this, forever infinite
Then reminesce, twenty years later how we was gettin' it
Either with me go against the grain you better hit me
Leggin me or robbin me niggaz better body me
'Cause it's a small world and niggaz, talkin' like bitches
Bitches singin' like snitches, pointin you out in pictures
'Cause she rep the QBC faithfully, playa hatin' me
All that bullshit, is just makin' me
More the better, then concentrate on gettin' chedda
If shorty set you up you better dead her, I told you
Shape and mold you, Sun you, then I hold you
Like a pimp mind control you double edge blow you
It'll be I, like I'm supposed to, the click is coastal
International to local, Bacardi mix physically fix
Hit you with shit, that'll leave a loose nigga stiff
Probably thick, Son I solved em
Pulled him in my world then evolved him to chaos
Walk the beat like, around the way cops the average pitstop
QBCity GodFather Part III, Gotti Gambino
And Ty Nitty, Scarface rest in peace

Yo, the heavy metal king hold big shit, with spare clips
You seein clips when the mac spit your top got split
Layin dead with open eyes close his eyelids
Turn off his lights switch to darkness, cause deep in the abyss
Is street life, blood on my kicks, shit on my knife
Youse the wild child, kid cold turnin' men into mice
I was born to take power leave my mark on this planet
The Phantom of Crime Rap, niggaz is left stranded
Shut down your operation, closed for business
Leave a foul taste in your mouth, like Guinness
POW niggaz is found MIA
We move like the special forces, green beret
Heavily around my throat, I don't play
Shit brand new, back in eighty-nine, the same way
The God P walk with a limp see, but simply
To simplify shit, no man can go against me
Test me you must be bent G, don't tempt me
I had this full clip for so long, it needs to empty
The reason why it full for so long, 'cause I don't waste shit
You probably hid, blood in your mouth, so you could taste it
Quiet as kept, I lay back and watch the world spin
I hear thugs, claimin that they gonna rob the Mobb
When they see us, I tell you what black, here's the issue
It's a package deal, you rob me, you take this message
Along with that, I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm tryin' to make CREAM and that's that
Whatever it takes however it gots to go down
Four mikes on stage a motherfuckin four pound
Speakers leakin out sound and niggaz leakin on the ground
I could truly care less the God will get his
Regardless blow for blow let's find out who wear hardest
This rap artist used to be a stickup artist
Sometimes I test myself see if I still got it
A live nigga stay on point never diss
Regard shit or forget the essence, from which I emerged
P is sick, so save that bullshit for the burbs
Live up to my word, if I got beef, niggaz comin' in herds

The future never known
A black hole of undivine nature for destruction of heresy
The stellar cycle about to be sucked into the imploding dark star to resurface an early cycle of man for a new millennium
Closure begins in collapse,
Dissolving into the raven giant
We are timeless... within damnation
Outer descent thrown into a reversal of extinction
No emotion within this promise of damnation
On sorelines of the perverse
The
Armageddon of prophecies unfold
This threshold of an event horizon
Collapses into a closure of negative density
Look past the stories of life
Look beyond these lies of a garden of delight
The serpents tale is only beginning of this interstellar rebirth
Hell's cold fire
Begin a cycle reborn
Devouring of utopia
Attain within non-escape
Haste to collide with this transi tional barrier that makes a dead man free
The cold ground is a warm death that leaves the personal idea of dying a lonesome rebirth
Grasp towards the sky from within this depression
As mountains of scattered head stones lay
A far worse burial stigma becoming the inquisition
The black heart of cold faith
Bare this cross a tranquil agnostic epitaph
The delivery of a condemned ideal
The veil closes its swollen eyes from above

Near the kraken sleepeth stirs
Coral and bone

Infinite city
No sexy sneer
Hideous creation
Human and animal

Banter songs of rudeness to be adhered
Not on rocks that glisten
Harps to listen, comb hair
Tear right to pieces
Left to recess a watery grave

Sensing the blood of prey
Swimming in fear for life

Rolling over
Falling into jaws
Teeth that chatter
It distracts them all

The Fiji mermaid
She will let it know
Time is coming
To feed and gnaw

The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

And so it was that later
As the Miller told his tale
That a face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

She said there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might just as well've been closed

And so it was later
As the Miller told his tale
AThat a face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

Yo, you ain't gotta' ask, dog - who am I?
I walk in the street, my middle finger in the sky
And ever since a young boy, I had the hunger in my eye
So when you cut the check, if you don't gimmie mine

(Chorus: Blam)
It's a - suicide, it's a suicide
It's a - suicide, it's a suicide
It's do or die
If you want that GRIT
And you're about the DOUGH
Better do it like a G, baby!

They ask, ""What's that?""

Better relax and say ""What's up, baby boo?""

Dammit, I can't blow it
I got a judge telling me my life's key
They will throw it
No sir
I plan to have a chauffeur
It seems to me this chopping crack is really going no where

Therefore
I'm resurrected
They call me
The poor injection
I infect you with the real
The dustyfeetphilosahectagos
I spit, so sick
I skid out
I'm fallin'
I'm shit outta luck and I'm trapped but I'll get out

Can you help me
I'm going crazy
My mom plays trix and I beat on the floor like bush wick
My fists bloody and blistered
A pair like I'm ballistic
I just stare at the red and smile while I'm bleeding

There are a few things you gotta take into account
I'm not an entertainer I've never been a clown
I was born where the mothers give birth while they frown
I would walk with the kids that would bra sound ah
Never really thought I'd make it to fourteen
And anybody wanted to fight I was most keen
Plus I had a little temper it was often foreseen
Yo say something bout my momma id shoot ya dead out clean
But ya gotta keep in mind that I grew up Mogadishu (tell em)
The only law was gun law
And we don't walk with a pistol
You get laughed at for being so insensitive to the environment
Cause how will you be heard when those big boys are firin'
War is no place for a child
Especially if hes rollin' with an ak and a smile
He had witnesses on mother bloody in a towel
But please, please, please, please
But never let 'em see you down smile while you bleedin'"

Defenders of Old fields

Gathered in the forest
Preparing their arms
Together they stand for valhall
Lords of the wolves
Till the day of crucial war

Years went by
When their fiend was banned
Land and honour were free
They gathered in fynn's tavern
Conferred about what has to be done
To protect their country knowingly
That the enemy will turn back
They decided to call the ancient ones
Who are resting in the woods

I call you, awake now, you brave ones
Dwellers of the fog
Raise your swords an fight against
The ones who attack us, at once

Woods waiting for the final call
No one will be spared, when day
Of war has come

Once by gone an era
The dwellers of the fog
With our fathers they stood
Side by side as in tales it's told

With horses formed by wrath
And blades made of fire
When they call for battle

He's somethin' of a city slicker

And her mommas been in Arkansas with her ailin' pa

It might be too late and it would be a pity
Better call up the sheriff in Calhoun city
And have the preacher organize a 'vestigating committee
To see what's going on

Tearing down the road in a pickup truck
With Bentley out taking the lead
Followed by a tractor and a half lame mule
Dust flyin' as they picked up speed

Faces beaming goodness and their jaw's set hard
Good people just doin' what's right
And off in the distance was Abell's house
And there wasn't a soul in sight
Aw, I could'a told you
(Oh, I just knew it)

Now the gravel was flying as he turned the bend
And screeched to a grinding halt
They went through the fence, into the flower bed
And hit pa's first-prize hog in the head
And left half a dozen mama's chickens for dead
But it wasn't nobody's fault

Oh, look at Harvey's prize hog
And all of them darlin' old grown bad trusty chickens
(We got more important things to tend to, boy)
I wonder if they're covered?

Committee bounded on the front porch
To meet the enemy face to face
But Abell yelled at 'em through the screen door
""Y'all messed up my daddy's place""

But in her hand she waved a policy
Sayin' with a Mona Lisa grin
""Well, y'all timed that one just about right

Gives you something to use

Maybe I should practice it one more time
Maybe I'm afraid what it might do
Maybe it might upset someone
Maybe that's what its supposed to do

Pull it from the bottom
It begins to change
Find another existence
That's what ure trying to say?

I'm not pushin you out
I'm not pushin you off
I'm not pushin you out
I'm not pushin u

All of the lands are terribly restless
With tellin' you what to do
But you go bak to the land
Where ure defensless
They act just like me and u

Look what u've don't to me
Look what I've done to u
Look what they've done to us
Now were like no one else
Theyre laughin' at u
Talkin' about u
All these new things
All these new things
I found in use

And I'm workin so hard
When I think it is real
Everybody does once
Just to see how it feels
It's not a sensation
And it's not for sale
So what can you call it now?

Keep 'em gotten
They'll spoil you rotten
Keep 'em gotten
Keep 'em gotten
Just another freak
Be another freak
Be a freak"

I think I wanna fuck my bitch Goldie and shit
Only because she got some money for me and shit
I think about fuckin' her

And go fuck my other bitch that live in fuckin' big houses
I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do but check it
How you spell cash? C's and some hash
At last, a nigga kickin' game full blast

How you want it, diamonds or dimeelles
Jan sport book bags and bags from Chanel
And seebeeaki, smellin' up my Kawasaki
Jawns by Versace all them joints by Jockey

Clock me workin' real hard for a nickel
He drive a tricycle and his pants too little
And his shoes too little
Won't you get with the clique with the big ass dicks

That make sure your kicks fit
The real shit, true, balla pack steel shit
The nigga with, the movie and the mill shit
Mass appeal get me in the clubs for free

So all you got to do for me is just
Make your way to my king sized bed
And lie on my pillows and my Gucci bed spread
Keep your pussy, I got other plans instead
Just gimme some head, gimme some head

If you ain't suckin' no dick, we don't need it, we don't need it
If you ain't lickin' no clits, we don't want it, we don't want it
If you ain't drinkin' no nut, we don't need it, we don't need it
If you ain't lickin' no butts, we don't want it, we don't want it

Some bitches do and some bitches don't
Ride a dick till he bust shit I know I won't
Niggas cum too fast for me
A waste of a good dick if you ask me

I like a nigga like to put his back in it
If it's a weave fuck around and pull a track in it
All I get, few strokes that's it
This bomb ass shit's got your cigarettes lit

Who me, forced to use plan B, masturbate, play with the pussy
This nigga here bust off snorin'
He straight, I knew this date would be borin'
I wanna wake him up to do his duty

Nigga use that tongue, click the booty, click the booty
You wanna steal the pussy like a thief
Now kiss the lips without the teeth
So I could bust a nut or two come clean like Jeru
Goodnight to you too boo

If you ain't suckin' no dick, we don't need it, we don't need it
If you ain't lickin' no clits, we don't want it, we don't want it
If you ain't drinkin' no nut, we don't need it, we don't need it
If you ain't lickin' no butts, we don't want it, we don't want it

Nine out of ten women, want to spit, on the skin of Blake Carrington
But I need much more to get raw, dick to jaw, dick to jaw
You drinkin' babies, don't wanna hear baby strictly, yes boo
Well if he cum up on your chest slow

If not then your not down with me
Little Caesar, Van Clef, or B.I.G.
Capone, Nino, or Bugsy
Don't ask Kim for a date, she want her pussy ate

If you ain't suckin' no dick, we don't need it, we don't need it
If you ain't lickin' no clits, we don't want it, we don't want it

Its more on roc when the Mobb walks in

Spit fire with nines but never squealed on you

I understood you should try to take my life
If I was you I would too damn right
If I had drama with a nigga like such as myself
I couldn't even sleep at night until...
I made things right
Pull out guns exchange a fight
Be the first to let off mines ignite the pipes...
And never let the daylight deceive
During the suns' hours niggaz do bleed
Aim for the waist and something on the top gets shot
Niggaz can't shoot never made a thing drop
Keep cream of the crop

Smell the barrell when its bolt-locked nigga

Risky on point hope these cats is getting the point whisper out my name

And ain't no time better than the present one at hand
And never keep your shit too far from your hand

Lost in their overcoats, waiting for the sunset
The sounds of the city sifting through trees
Settle like dust on the shoulders of the old friends

Across the Red Sea like God had planned
Well, you'd think that when He opened up that mighty sea
That all the people would surely believe

But you can heal the sick
Raise the dead
Turn the sky from a blue to a red
It don't matter what they hear or what they see
Some people they never believe

Noah was the only man on earth that was good
So God said, ""Build an ark of resinous wood.""
Well, a lot of people laughed and called him a fool
But Noah didn't mind 'cause he knew for sure

That you can heal the sick
Raise the dead
Turn the sky from a blue to a red
It don't matter what they hear or what they see
Some people they never believe

Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego
Were told that in the fireplace they must go
Well, you'd think that when the people saw
They just wouldn't burn
That all the doubters would finally learn

That you can heal the sick
Raise the dead
Turn the sky from a blue to a red
It don't matter what they hear or what they see
Some people they never believe

Jesus came to earth to save all men
To take upon Himself a world of sin
But the people didn't care what He said or He did
They only knew that they wanted Him dead

Though He healed the sick
Yes, He raised the dead
Though He could turn the sky from a blue to red
It didn't matter what they'd heard or what they'd seen
Some people refused to believe

A lot of people now are dying in sin
Waiting for a miracle to prove to them
But though miracles keep happening again and again
They still don't believe and they never will

'Cause you can heal the sick
Raise the dead
Turn the sky from a blue to red
It don't matter what they hear or what they see
Some people they never believe."

Way out there in the prairie air I guess it's in my hide
Oh the clickety clack of the railroad track is callin'
If a man could know where the Santa Fe goes when she gets under steam
And the big loud bell that bongs farewell to hear her whistle scream
She's bound to go where there ain't no snow a fallin'
One more ride
One more ride

I miss the gloom of the prairie moon that seemed to know my name
And the tumbleweed where the prairie don't feed I miss them just the same
They're all a part of a song of heart I'm sayin'
I recall the tune that I sang to the moon and it seemed to make it smile
And I rode away at the close of day and I stayed so long awhile
But I long to be where the memory is ringing
One more ride
One more ride

As the years go by I wonder why I longed to leave my home
And to hit the trail of the iron rail away out there alone
But my heart would sigh till I know that I am leavin'
If I don't come back on a oneway track way down from Mexico
You could find me there or any old where that a tumbleweed will grow
It's a goodbye now you'll never know how I'm grievin'

Oh shit, what the fuck did I do?
It's all my fucking fault man, it's all my fucking fault
Fuck man, fuck am I doing man, why man
Why God, why did you have to take her? Fuck...

(Sticky)
Why? Why? Why God why?
Everything I love always seems to die
Answer me, speak to me, I don't hear you
Answer me, motherfucker I ain't scared of you
Is there even a God? Do you even exist?
What I gotta do to speak to you slit my wrists?
I'm talking to a God that I can't see
Can you see me? Can you see me?

(God)
Are you confused my son, and scared?
Let me make things more clear, so you're more aware

(Sticky)
Fuck who was that all this shit is freaking me

(God)
It is I God did you not say you wanted to speak with me?

(Sticky)
Bullshit I am talking to myself, I'm going insane

(God)
You are talking to yourself we are one of the same

(Sticky)
It can't be it must be the drugs I'm high
And if you are then why are we born if we live to die?
Is there life after death? What were we before birth?
Why is this whole earth plagued and cursed?
Is killing a sin is there life in other planets?
Is adultery wrong did you write the ten commandments?

(God)
Excuse me my son, one question at a time
We were never born, and we will never die
In the essence, there Is no such thing as death
How could I write commandments and not have them kept?
The soul is eternal you just change form
Then you come back with a new face on
You can not limit love unless you lack understanding
To answer you yes there is life in other planets
The futures a mystery the past is history
Today is a gift that's why it is called the present
Life is so simple unless you make it confusing
The wise ones stand us and the clever we are using

(Sticky)
Wait - God, there is so much I want to ask you
God, God? Where are you? God I need to talk to you

If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God

(Sticky)
Tell me, are there psychics that can speak telepathically?

(God)
Yes but if you use more than one tenth of the minds capacity

(Sticky)
I can't think I feel life going down the drain
In the streets everywhere I am surround in pain

(God)
Don't think, your thoughts are just that- thoughts
Your feelings will really erase what you been taught
Feelings are the language of the soul the soul is truth
I speak through you to aware the youth

(Sticky)
But why let the suffering go on why not just stop it?

(God)
In order for anything to exist, so much is opposite
How can there be left if there was never right?
How can something know death if it never knew life?
How can you lose, if nobody won?
How can it be dark if there was never a sun?
That which is not grandeur, the soil still blessed
Form must exist for part of themself to manifest

(Sticky)
But I never asked to be born, I hate my life
And if you are God dammit then show me the light
And tell me- what's the meaning of life?

(God)
The process of all life
Is an ongoing, never-ending process of recreation of self

(Sticky)
Is God a he or she is there one true religion?

(God)
I'm the Alpha, the Omega, the beginning and ending
We are all one and everything is living

If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God"

I walked away the wind blows
And any way the wind goes will be good enough for me

But I walk my weary way lost and alone

Keep flashin' through my mind to warm me

She was an angel in the devil's clothes
But I'd lose my grip when she'd shake her hips and right now I think she knows
That I'm in deep - I play the game

Is she the one to make me tame?

That I'm out to get her - she goes with the flow
'Cause she likes to play games with me
So damn sexy in a subtle way
Breakin' me down with everything she say
Make the best man feel he's just O.K.

Who's 2 blame???

And I was just the one of the hands
Who hearded ten thousand cattles
On their ten thousand acres of land.

But I was a very poor cowboy
And we lived in worlds far apart
So how could I tell her I loved her
Or speak of the love in my heart.

The lady I loved never knew

A poor cowboy's heart broke in two.

Or notice that I'm even gone

Now rides through the dark night alone.

You made so sure of that you
Tried to keep me down here
Your complacency has been your downfall

Nobody made you king of the world
And now I'm here to dethrone
So kiss the ring motherfucker
It's my time, my time to shine
Grasping for the straws as they fall
Maybe you'll make a splint 
For your broken ego
For your broken ego

And I say thank you for the scars 
And the guilt and the pain
Every tear I never cried
Has sealed your fucking fate
Did you take me for a fool
Or were you just too blind to see
That every effort made has failed
And there is no destroying me?

Hate can be a positive emotion
When it forces you to better yourself
You built me, constructed my desire, perfected my hatred
Now I'm driven to be 
Ten times better than you think you are
Ten times better than you think you are

Piece by piece I built my walls and burned my bridges down
That lead back to people like you
So full of malice, so full of scorn
You tried your best to crush my spirit
You tried to steal my soul
You pushed my back against the wall
And I broke it down

I will not be broken, though I am the one that bleeds
I will not be broken, I am the one
I will not be broken, though I am the one that bleeds
I will not be broken, I am the one

I will not be broken, though I am the one that bleeds
I will not be broken, I am the one

And I say thank you for the scars 
And the guilt and the pain
Every tear I never cried

Even the earth is movin in different places in outer space
But one thing remains the same till the end of time
I think I'll remain, I think I'll just stay...

A b-boy standin in my b-boy stance

From the top of the highest summit, again we run it.
A hundred and forty four shimmering lights stunnin
Too quick for the human eye to catch a glimpse
You know pimps cannot convince with bigger attempts of emcee'in,
Blowing words in the wind,
While we ascend to limitless ends and pretend
We're still human, when if fact we're only half
The other path extends infinity do the max
I try to laugh, but they pull me down like crabs in a bucket
With hands in my pocket, how long will it last?
Heaven only knows, so Kheaven keeps inventing the flows
That turns black prose to white foes
Your just supposin have you heard my words
Moving at light speed and getting blurred.
It's all so incredible decibles at glance standing in a b-stance

A B-boy standin in my B-boy stance

This one leads the way...
Now cut it up, cut it up back to back, on the wheels of steel, cut it up back to back

Elevate, Meditate, eliminate
Thoughts from my past keep knocking upon my gate
Shouldn't let 'em in, the answers not to debate
But to observe the debating and then we can all escape

Yo party people listen up at the drop of the dime,
They took cameras to Africa for pictures to rhyme
Over oh... yes, the great pretenders
Religious entertainers who want to be life savers
Damn... another dollar for the mind, another cold ??? hoping
They can't find, they can't copy or get pictures with no lines,
I guess it's just a case of the blind leading the blind
But, I'm flippin and steppin and rockin' the roll,
Taking control, payin' my tolls, losing control
I'm playin' a role so people will remember that
I'm just a servant of rap, hopin to bring it back

I'm a B-boy standin in my B-boy stance

This one leads the way... break

I'm just a B-Boy calling death to Troy"

We beat indifferent drum, we pound it till we're numb 

We validate, rationalize, corroborate each others lives 
Pat my back and I'll pat yours, benevolent conquistadors 
We piss down throats, shit in cupped hands 
Wipe our asses with all foreign flags 
We beat indifferent drum, we pound it till we're numb

Hitting mad sparks
Pass me the mic and I'll be rocking the whole park

Crack the hit then fucked it up, and baby gangstas was full of they cluck.
Pluck the feathers up off the duck, you stuck like chuck if carried the banter
Pistol player knuckled up, then better to telling the children to scatter
Everyone knows don't fuck with them ho's drinking with keisha from out they yo
Full of that clearly pop a silly when niggas first heard the choppers city
And I was a dancin' b-boy who resorted to slinging them heat boys
And jackin' them cars, mackin' them broads, sadistic shit, then flipped the script.
I don't wan' sound like a hypocrite, but momma raised me for greatness,
But we broke as fuck and hope is stuck and New Orleans defines the cage hits

Roar roar like the dungeon dragon, takin' it back to the cannibals house

Them niggas are hazards, we bitchin' they crabbin', and changin lanes like benjamin massing
From 10 to 12 they thinkin' it's cool, something awful when they ain't in the mood.
Don't get 'em bent, fuck that innocence, cause in a sense they film as you.
Where they mommas at, where they mommas at? Nobody knows, nobody cares.
To claim your hard, come go through the ward, come fuck with them, when nobody dares
Your job, yes, ya ho-jocker, put that pop on you like Redenbacher
The things they say, the slang they use, catching kung fu while they bangin' the tools.

There's a rumbling in the skies
I've been wading through the high muddy water
With the heat rising in my eyes

Every day your memory grows dimmer
It doesn't haunt me like it did before
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

When I was in Missouri
They would not let me be
I had to leave there in a hurry
I only saw what they let me see

You broke a heart that loved you
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
I've been walking that lonesome valley
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

People on the platforms
Waiting for the trains
I can hear their hearts a-beatin'
Like pendulums swinging on chains

When you think that you've lost everything
You find out you can always lose a little more
I'm just going down the road feeling bad
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

I'm going down the river
Down to New Orleans
They tell me everything is gonna be all right
But I don't know what ""all right"" even means

I was riding in a buggy with Miss Mary Jane
Miss Mary Jane got a house in Baltimore
I been all around the world, boys
Now I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

Gotta sleep down in the parlor
And relive my dreams
I'll close my eyes and I wonder
If everything is as hollow as it seems

Some trains don't pull no gamblers
No midnight ramblers, like they did before
I been to Sugartown, I shook the sugar down
Now I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door"

And the cold is complete
And it only lacks a presence
And nothing else

Like Ricochet ping ping ping.
I make fans fell it even when I sing.
The green eyed bandit coming funky with the tune yes
I'm blowing up like Tom Berringer in Platoon.
I'm playing kinda ruff like Zapp
Whapp and E-Double smack to all the crossover raps black
Who ain't down with the format
When you should be wearing khakis and not dress slacks
That's wack
You trippin' you better wake up and smell the coffee
And then back up off me
I serious I can't believe some people letting frontiers in
And then compare them equal boy you must be buggin
You lucky you don't catch a slug in the chest in
From the Smith and Wessons.
Change the out look
Change the cover of the book
You hip hop crook and give back what you took.
It's the Funk coming at cha
So don't let the crossover catch ya.
Boy stay real.

II.

It's on again yeah about the fake hip hop trends
For those who can't comprehend just ask your friends
They know the real deal of rap music no frontin
You can't be talking loud and saying nothing
You must be true to the game you understand
And if not I could kill you man
For being false plus extra fake on the tape
Talking hardcore when you soft like a piece of cake.
You can't put nothing pass me that horrendous cause
I've been here since strictly business
The era of Eric and Rakim, Biz, Public Enemy, Run-DMC,
Houdini, The Beasties, Stetsa, Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff, LL
When he was rockin' bells.
Sucker which fake emcee is rearranging the structure band
The motherf--ker. And don't let this happen again
Cause rap could be gone the wind.
So stay real.

III.

Yes I'm back Black for those who might be confused
And lost and don't wanna pay the cost
Of me hardcore style type a human being
On the microphone when I be emceeing.
Some fake the Funk and Main Source know it
How do I know cause MTV shows it.
Clowns that should be beat down on the spot
And catching nothing but speed knots the bumbadots
I insist we veto all fake emcees and wanna be's
That's worst than the AIDS disease.
So wake up Spike Lee Joint
And don't be a knucklehead and get to the point
With the Funk and pump up the volume
Make the wild tune to make the party boom
Peace to Redman the Rap Funkadelic
The only emcee that's compared to Erick because I'm real."

So very far away
A little child would be born
And in a manger laid
And who would have tho't this little child
Was born the King of kings
The Son of just a carpenter
But for whom the angels sing
And who would have tho't that as He grew
And with other children played
This child with whom they laughed and sang
Would die for them some day
And who would have tho't this little child
Could make a blind man see
Feed the hungry make rich the poor
And set the sinner free
Oh who would have tho't this little child
Was who the prophets said
Would take away the sins of man
And rise up from the dead

O I believe and I will always sing
This little child is the King
O I believe and I will always sing
This little child
He is the King of kings

Many years have come and gone
Yet this world remains the same
Empires have been built and fallen
Only time has made a change
Nation against nation
Brother against brother
Men so filled with hatred
Killing one another
And over half the world is starving
While our banner of decency is torn
Debating over disarmament
Killing children before they're born
And fools who march to win the right
To justify their sin
Oh ev'ry nation that has fallen
Has fallen from within
Yet in the midst of this darkness
There is a hope a light that burns
This little child the King of kings
Some day will return

And I believe and I will always sing
This little child is the King
And I believe and I will always sing
This little child
He is the King of kings

And who would have tho't this little child
Is who the prophets said
Will return to judge this world
The living and the dead
Oh can't you see that long ago
So very far away
This little child our only hope
Was born a King that day
And can't you see that here and now
As unto Him we pray
This Lord of lords who is our hope
Is still King today
He's still the King today"

Well, it could be a boy
But it's okay if he's girl
Oh, these things that grow out of
The things that we give

We should move to the west side
They still believe in things
That give a kid half a chance

When he pulled off the road
Step in a waltz of ted moon-beams
Said he fit an APB,
A robbery nearby

And he go for his wallet
And they thought he was going for a gun
And the cops blew Bird away

Some kids like watching Saturday cartoons
Some girls listen to records all day in their rooms
But what do birds leave behind, of the wings that they came with
If a son's in a tree building model planes?

This blood drenched man, seemed to cry for help, as he stared at me, his eyes were changing.
Rising to his feet, incapacitated, puking violently, charging straight for me.
With his mouth opened wide drooling intensely, I leapt the fence and ran inside.
In the house I hide, barricading everything, what would come next?
Terrified, running up the stairs, finally found the shotgun kept under my bed.
It's time to put an end to this nightmare; I'll end your life as quickly as I chose to save it.
Removing the Debris only to see, the starving man behind me, as he pounced I never had a chance.

II. ""Home""

The dreamer and the wine
Poet without a rhyme
A widowed writer torn apart by chains of hell

One last perfect verse
Is still the same old song
Oh Christ how I hate what I have become

Take me home

Getaway, runaway, fly away
Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway
I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Forgive me
I have but two faces
One for the world
One for God
Save me
I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world

My home was there 'n then
Those meadows of heaven
Adventure-filled days
One with every smiling face

Please, no more words
Thoughts from a severed head
No more praise
Tell me once my heart goes right

Take me home

Getaway, runaway, fly away
Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway
I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world

Sparkle my scenery
With turquoise waterfall
With beauty underneath
The Ever Free

Tuck me in beneath the blue
Beneath the pain, beneath the rain
Goodnight kiss for a child in time
Swaying blade my lullaby

On the shore we sat and hoped
Under the same pale moon
Whose guiding light chose you
Chose you all

""I'm afraid, so afraid
Being raped again, and again, and again
I know I will die alone
But loved

You live long enough to hear the sound of guns
Long enough to find yourself screaming every night
Long enough to see your friends betray you

For years I've been strapped unto this altar
Now I only have three minutes and counting
I just wish the tide would catch me first and give me a death I always longed for""

IV. ""Dark Passion Play""

Second robber to the right of Christ
Cut in half - infanticide
The world will rejoice today
As the crows feast on the rotting poet

Everyone must bury their own
No pack to bury the heart of stone
Now he's home in hell, serves him well
Slain by the bell, tolling for his farewell

The morning dawned, upon his altar
Remains of the dark passion play
Performed by his friends without shame
Spitting on his grave as they came

Getaway, runaway, fly away
Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway
I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Forgive me
I have but two faces
One for the world
One for God
Save me
I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Whore for the cold world
Whore for the cold world

Cracking a smile disguises
All the underlying lies
They're bursting from your eyes

You're the traitor with a pounding head
As you drank another toast to the living dead
It's not wise to celebrate so soon
The party's over and you're sweeping up the room

I'm only glad that I brushed you aside
'Cause I was choking on the dust from your empty mind
You're full of promises unpaid
This only serves to remind me you're a fake
A counterfeit will break

Spare me your bullshit
Cracking a smile disguises
All the underlying lies
They're bursting from your eyes
They're burstin' from your eyes

Burstin' from your eyes"

Who turned out the light?
But hatch from the things, I don't know what it means
But it was too much to bear.

If I had taken my time, counted my steps
I might have no regrets
You might still be here yet and not in my dreams
It's too late to care.

I was born of the womb of a poisonous man
Beaten and broken and chased from the land
But I rise up above it, high up above it and see
I was hung from the tree made of tongues of the weak
The branches, the bones of the liars and thieves
Rise up above it, high up above and see

Pray to your god, open your heart
Whatever you do, don't be afraid of the dark
Cover your eyes, the devil's inside

One night of the hunter
One day I will get revenge
One night to remember
One day it'll all just end, oh

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Blessed by a bitch from a bastard's seed
Pleasure to meet you but better to bleed
Rise, I will rise, I will rise
Skinned her alive, ripped her apart
Scattered her ashes, buried her heart
Rise up above it, high up above and see

Pray to your god, open your heart
Whatever you do, don't be afraid of the dark
Cover your eyes, the devil inside

One night of the hunter
One day I will get revenge
One night to remember
One day it'll all just end, oh

Tear you to pieces and rip you apart
Honest to God I'll break your heart

Kid watch your back one time it's comin' always
They lock me up for 12 days I can't comprehend
Now I'm a free man on the streets again
Chasin' St. Ides down with some Seagrams Gin
Life is like a dice game and I'm into win
On the scene from the 41st side of Queens
We get the cream laid up love love for dame
'Cause I mean what I mean, I'm out to claim king
Doin' my thing, do wild stakes my namell reign

To all my peoples locked down comin' back to life
In the world once again though ya fear was trife
While you was gone, we was goin' to war and even more
Saw my man layin' dead on the floor, kid I swore
That our crew will live forever, I guess I was wrong
No, until we meet again, hold ya head and stay strong (yeah)
Yo, got my mind on a place to hide from police (where)
Sweatin' dogs as I'm runnin' cross 12th Street
Just as I approach the block
I spot a jake on the creep down by Vicks weed spot (so what)
Made a you-ey up the hill plus a change of plans
I had to hurry back so I could warn my man

Ya had me stressin' little son, had my heart rapidly pumpin'
Niggas start a guttin' behind the bushes duckin'
My ears rung, I punch a clip into the guns
Got in the arm, one slug hit my son
He was bleedin' from the head I couldn't believe it
We was defeated if it was a case I couldn't beat it
Felt like cryin' (the temperatures risin')
I saw my man helpless, damn near on the verge of dyin'
So to P I passed the iron

Kid you ain't lyin'
I went to stash the murder weapon, plus I'm relyin'
On a door to be open, goin' in the building, it's a trap
Police buckin' at me, they try to twist my tongue back
Jetted up the staircase to the third floor
Reached behind the sink, throw the heater on the floor
Locked the door, police grabbed me up and tried to break my jaw
So where's the gun we saw? (I don't know)
We know you was there at the homicide scene (I know nuttin')
And if it wasn't you, was somebody from ya team

(Chrous)
From the cradle to the grave
(From the cradle to the grave)

(Repeat: x2)
Straight from the motherfuckin' cradle to the grave

Yo, it's the real drama kills, nobody moves, stand still
Bottle you drop that ass off in a land fill
Son bless me with the iron, I got beef
With some niggas from the other side over some weak shit
Load up the heaters, greet 'em with the hollow tips
Flip 'em like the Gotti clip my crew shift the body shift
The cradle to the grave is where I'll end up
Fuck gettin' sent up north, son I'm better
Doin' my dirt on a low
Fuckin' wit them mobbers like a crowd
No doubt you gonna blow you never know
He didn't even have to go there
Unprepared now he's six below
Why know I'm chillin', I gots no time for catchin' feelings
Get that money I wants, some brothers want to act funny
But it's all good I still die for the hood

For my peoples, yeah knock on wood
Triple L, rollin' dice while I put you on
To the drama what I gotta say is short not long
This nigga that I'm beginning to dislike he got me fed
If he doesn't discontinue his bullshit he might be dead
Know him well and probably go way back
But I don't care if he's your man doin' shit like that
I hope the word gets back to him, 'cause I screw him
He shitted on my man and we got plans to do him
Let's get it over with quick, I'm tired of waitin'
Ain't no fair overhead there we just debatin' on when and how
Later on right now, spoke to Killa yesterday

He said to chill for a while
But it's hard acting like everything is all right
I get the chills when I see that nigga in my sight
A dead man walking not only that he's still talkin'(about what)
About how what he did buried off and you don't know
How much I fiend to put his ass in a coffin
One day my man and the next he's not
Didn't know him long anyway so fuck it
It's funny how things change (word up)

Word up man
Why know what I'm sayin' we gonna die
It's for real, kid no games bein' played"

It all began on the street, to the back of a blue police vehicle
Next come the bookends, the way things is looking
It's Friday, you in for a long stay, gettin' shackled on the bus
First thing come Monday, hoping in your mind you'll be released one day
But knowing, home is a place you're not going for a long while
Now you're up on the isle, in a position that you ain't got to, refusing
To smile
But keep in mind there's a brighter day, after your time spent
Used to be wild, but locked up, you can't get bent
Thought you could hack it, now you're requesting Pee, see you fragile
It ain't hard to see, niggas like that don't associate with me
I'd rather, get busy to the third degree
Cause the war populations are
If this was the street, my razor would be a mack demon
Hit you up, leave your whole face screaming, what you in for kid
Busting nuts, taps heard of million street stories caught inside this trap
Who are you to look at me with your eyes like that
Wising up young blood, before you make things escalate, and I would hate
To set your crooked ass straight

Make your moves at night, pack your heat in this warzone, niggas is trife
Runnin' from one time, ain't no time to slip, make one false move
And it's a up north trip
Livin' the high life, make your moves at night, pack your heat in this warzone
Niggas is trife, runnin' from one time, ain't no time to slip, make one
False move And it's a up north trip

Verse Two: Havoc

You tried to dip, duck, but still got bucked, you talk too much shit
You should have kept your mouth shut, all that gossip
Motherfucker don't you know my glock kicks, hollow tips
To your body, mad toxic, I fade you, blow you with a rusty-ass razor
Did you a favor, tried to wet you but I grazed you
Pop goes the glock when there's beef on the block, chill for a while
Make them think the beef stop, then I creep like a thief in the night
It's only right, ain't no turnin' back, it's on tonight, and if I get caught
Then my ass is up north, straight on the course for upstate New York
Stress, smokin' back to back cigaretttes, it popped off, gon' point in
The mess hall
But to avoid that, from head to toe, dipped in all black, hit them niggas
Where they pump they cracks at, Havoc, with the murder masterplan
Keep my nine up to par, so my shit won't jam, God forbid if my shit do
Run behind a tree, fix my shit then hit you, slugs in your body
Mainly in your brain tissue, witness from the scene, get ghost, stash
The pistol
So simple then, watch my back, lay up and relax, roll a sack, ?K-A black?
Find a shorty intact

Verse Three: Prodigy

I got the powder, combine wit the powder, and water, it oughtta
Drop in a half and hour, in the, form of oil, watch the cocaine boil
Keep my eye on it so the shit won't spoil, then I pause
And ask God why, did he put me on the serve, just so I could die
I sit back and build on, all the things I did wrong, why I'm still breathing
And all my friends gone, I try not to dwell on the subject for a while
'Cause I might get stuck in this corrupt lifestyle, but my
Heart pumps foul blood through my arteries, and I can't turn it back
It's a part of me, too late for cryin, I'm a grown man struggling
To reach the next level of life, without fumbling, down to folding
I got no shoulder to lean on but my own, all alone in this danger zone
Time waits for no man, the streets grow worse, fuck the whole world kid
My money comes first, 'cause I'm out for the gusto, and trust nobody
If you're not family, then you die by me, cause niggas will have you
Locked up
The snitch, be a man, givin' police the run down on your plans
We're never goin' down like that, so I, shut my mouth and hold my words back
The legal business, forever mine, fuck payin' taxes, the last kid that shitted

And gave police access, to my blueprints, used names as evidence
Skipped town and I haven't seen the snitch nigga ever since
The moral of the story is easy to figure out, a lesson that you can't
Live without

Repeat Chorus once
*Livin' the high life"

You ever want something
That you know you shouldn't have
The more you know you shouldn't have it,
The more you want it
And then one day you get it,
It's so good too
But it's just like my girl
When she's around me
I just feel so good, so good
But right now I just feel cold, so cold
Right down to my bones
'Cause ooh...
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away

I know, I know, I know, I know,
I know, know, know, know, know,
I know, I know,
Hey I ought to leave
I ought to leave her alone

(Black Thought)
Yo my definition is a lyricist for hire
My vocal's a passport that never expire
Crowd loud like fifty rounds of gun fire
Screamin out ""The Roots"" while I balance wit the wire
Yo, expert in this profession, the session
In 1987, I linked up wit the ?uestion
Eleven years later we shared crop wit Geffen
In musical hell, but hip-hop forever heaven
My thoughts, interwoven and deep like Beethoven
This foul world so filled of shit it like a clogged up colon
Swollen wit minds that got stolen
Fake-ass cops, uncontrollable patrolmen
Torture, blood flow like bodies of water
Fathers sexually assaultin they own daughter
Out of sync, outta order like a puzzle
In the land of the unseen hand that hold juggle
In a Game of Life, yo it's hard to roll a double
Tryin' times, take lives and separate couples
Kids thinkin' they grown, tellin' they moms ""Fuck you""
Under they breath, livin' in the last times left
Peep the imagery ?strep?, across the sky like a canvas
And we're the artists beneath vigorous rough strokes of darkness
Time to set it off, let's spark this
Switzerland, LET'S SPARK THIS!
We are the ULTIMATE (rock-rockin' it)
We are the ULTIMATE (rock-rockin' it)
We are the ULTIMATE, rock-rockin' it, rock-rockin' it, rock-rockin' it

(Rock-rockin' it) C'mon (Rock-rockin' it) C'mon (Rock-rockin' it)
Yo my definition is a lyricist for hire
You couldn't have a clue, it's about to transpire
The books I buy live arms ?I wire?
The Fifth, similar to ghetto gospel choir
We ex-plore the whole states plus record
In flight buds, trip that was a prisoner in war
Four-four the corridor, seal it, no floor
But I could see the drop was a mile aboard
To the bottom, electrical shock for rhymes
I said ""I don't got em"", guess it kinda presented a problem
When I understood, they said ""Let him go""
I woke, during a center to London?
And now wit a past, fuckin' wit border patrol
I'm findin it out, I'm leakin wit my people
Hit the studio, spread this information
In daze of frustration fogged the education
&gt;From Illa-Fifth to Switzerland destination
The Roots du journ, go check the translation
The dictionary of devout topics, far from ebonics
The Fifth Dynast, they can't stop it
Yo Zurlich y'all keep it tight heed
While The Roots Crew smoke weed
Yo, we are the ULTIMATE (rock-rockin' it)
We are the ULTIMATE, say what? (rock-rockin' it)
We are the ULTIMATE, c'mon
(Rock-rockin' it) C'mon c'mon rock-rockin' it, rock-rockin' it
We are the ULTIMATE (rock-rockin' it)
We are the ULTIMATE LOUDER (rock-rockin' it)
We are the ULTIMATE LOUDER
(Rock-rockin' it) C'mon rock-rockin' it, rock-rockin' it
