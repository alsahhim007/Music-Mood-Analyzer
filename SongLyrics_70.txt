Everybody knows one
Song sung blue
Every garden grows one

Me and you
The subject too
The blues now and then
But when you take the blues and make a song
You sing them out again
Sing them out again

Song sung blue
Weeping like a willow
Song sung blue
Sleeping on my pillow

Funny thing,
But you can sing it with a cry in your voice
And before you know, it got to feeling good
You simply got no choice

Me and you
The subject to the blues now and then
But when you take the blues and make a song
You sing them out again

Song sung blue
Weeping like a willow
Song sung blue
Sleeping on my pillow

Funny thing, but you can sing it with a cry in your voice
And before you know, it start to feeling good
You simply got no choice

Song sung blue
Song sung blue

Funny thing, but you can sing it with a cry in your voice
And before you know, it start to feeling good
You simply got no choice They sat together in the park
As the evening sky grew dark
She looked at him and he felt a spark
Tingle to his bones
'Twas then he felt alone
And wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate

They walked alone by the old canal
A little confused, I remember well
And stopped into a strange hotel
With a neon burning bright
He felt the heat of the night
Hit him like a freight-
Train moving with a simple twist of fate

A saxophone someplace far off played
As she was walking on by the arcade
As the light bust through a beat up shade
Where he was waking up
She dropped a coin into the cup
Of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate

He woke up; the room was bare
He didn't see her anywhere
He told himself he didn't care
Pushed the window open wide
Felt an emptiness inside
To which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate

He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks
Where the sailors all come in
Maybe she'll pick him out again
How long must he wait
One more time for a simple twist of fate

People tell me it's a sin
To know and feel too much within
I still believe she was my twin
But I lost the ring
She was born in spring
But I was born too late
Blame it on a simple twist of fate Come on, come on, come on, come on

Didn't I make you feel
Like you were the only man?
Yeah, an' didn't I give you nearly everything that a woman possibly can?
Honey, you know I did
And each time I tell myself that I, well, I think I've had enough
Well, what I'm gonna show you, baby, that a woman can be tough

I want you to come on, come on, come on, come on and take it
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
(Break it)
Break another little bit of my heart now, darlin', yeah
(Have a)
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
Well, you know you got it if it makes you feel good, oh yes indeed

You're out on the streets lookin' good
And baby deep down in your heart, I guess you know that it ain't right
Never, never, never, never, never, never hear me when I cry
Baby, I cry all the time
But each time I tell myself that I, well, I can't stand the pain
But when you hold me in your arms, I'm singin' once again

I said come on, come on, come on, come on and take it
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
(Break it)
Break another little bit of my heart now, darlin', yeah
(Have a)
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
Well, you know you got it, child, if it makes you feel good

I need you to come on, come on, come on, come on and take it
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
(Break it)
Break another little bit of my heart now, darlin', yeah, come on now
(Have a)
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
You know you got it, whoa
Take it
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
(Break it) 
Break another little bit of my heart now, darlin', yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Have a) 
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
You know you got it, child, if it makes you feel good She's been gone since yesterday
Oh I didn't care
Never cared for yesterdays
Fancies in the air

No sighs or mysteries
She lay golden in the sun
No broken harmonies
But I've lost my way

She had rainbow eyes
Rainbow eyes
Rainbow eyes

Love should be a simple blend
A whispering on the shore
No clever words you can defend
They lead to nevermore

No sighs or mysteries
She lay golden in the sun
No broken harmonies
But I've lost my way

She had rainbow eyes
Rainbow eyes
Rainbow eyes

Summer nights are colder now
They've taken down the fair
And all the lights have died somehow
Or were they ever there?

No sighs or mysteries
She lay golden in the sun
No broken harmonies
But I've lost my way

She had rainbow eyes
Ooh

They've taken down the fair In this world, if you read the papers, darling,

Yes, I had a woman
A real woman
Lord, she gave me lovin' both night and day
My sun shine
Woo hoo
For my woman
Or else or else
It's going to take me one more day
If it takes me
She went way down in Dallas
Way down in Texas land
Lord she had me wrapped around her wrist and around her finger baby
Like a ring wrapped around a finger of a severed hand
I'm lookin' for my Dallas honey bee
Where can you be
Where can you be
Ooh hoo hoo help me
Help me look for her
Oh yeah Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away

I told my mama how I feel about your power
Your love can heal, can't no doctor's remedy
Ever do what you do for me

Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Eeny weeny teeny bit of your love
Baby it's all I need, it's all I need

Since the day I've been loving you
I can't catch a cold, I can't catch the flu'
The sweet loving you've been giving me
Has become my daily need

Just a little o' your love, every day
It's all I need, that's all I need
Just a little bit baby
That's all I need, that's all I need

So don't send no doctor to my door
'Cause Doctor John been here before
Don't you send him, just come yourself
Bring your loving and nothing else

Ooh just a, just a, 
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away Spread out now Rosie; Doctor come cut loose her mama's reins
You know playin' blind man's bluff is a little baby's game
You pick up Little Dynamite I'm gonna pick up Little Gun
And together we're gonna go out tonight and make that highway run
You don't have to call me lieutenant Rosie and I don't want to be your son
The only lover I'm ever gonna need's your soft sweet little girl's tongue
And Rosie you're the one

Dynamite's in the belfry playin' with the bats
Little Gun's downtown in front of Woolworth's tryin' out his attitude on all the cats
Papa's on the corner waitin' for the bus
Mama she's home in the window waitin' up for us
She'll be there in that chair when they wrestle her upstairs 'cause you know we ain't gonna come
I ain't here for business baby, I'm only here for fun
And Rosie you're the one

Rosalita jump a little lighter,
Senorita come sit by my fire
I just want to be your lover ain't no liar,
Rosalita you're my stone desire

Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they're gonna be there
Ah Sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool,
Stay out all night, it's gonna feel all right
So Rosie come out tonight, Oh baby come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
Closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So use it Rosie, that's what it's there for

Rosalita jump a little lighter,
Senorita come sit by my fire
I just want to be your lover ain't no liar,
Rosalita you're my stone desire

Now I know your mama she don't like me 'cause I play in a rock and roll band
And I know your daddy he don't dig me but he never did understand
Your papa lowered the boom he locked you in your room
I'm comin' to lend a hand
I'm comin' to liberate you, confiscate you, I want to be your man
Someday we'll look back on this and it will all seem funny
But now you're sad, your mama's mad
And your papa says he knows that I don't...
(...Have any money)
Oh, your papa says he knows...
(...That I don't have any money)
Oh, so your daddy says he knows that I don't have...
(...Any money)
Well, tell him this is last chance
To get his daughter in a fine romance
Because a record company Rosie just gave me a big advance

And my tires were slashed and I almost crashed but the Lord had mercy
And my machine she's a dud out stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey
Well, hold on tight, stay up all night 'cause Rosie I'm comin' on strong
By the time we meet the morning light I will hold you in my arms
I know a pretty little place in Southern California down San Diego way
There's a little cafe where they play guitars all night and all day
You can hear them in the back room strummin'
So hold tight baby 'cause don't you know daddy's comin'

Rosalita jump a little lighter,
Senorita come sit by my fire
I just want to be your lover ain't no liar,
Rosalita you're my stone desire Get yourself a cooler, lay yourself low
Coincidental murder with nothin' to show
With the judge, constipation will go to his head
And his wife's aggravation, you soon end up dead

It's the same old story
Same old song and dance, my friend
It's the same old story
Same old song and dance, my friend

They gotcha with the cocaine they found with your gun
No smoothy face lawyer to get ya undone
Say love ain't the same on the south side of town
You could look but you ain't gonna find it around

It's the same old story
Same old song and dance, my friend
It's the same old story
Same old story, same old song and dance

Fate comes a-knockin'
Doors start lockin'
Your old time connections
Change your direction
Ain't gonna change it
Can't rearrange it
Can't stand the pain when
It's all the same to you, my friend

When you're lowdown and dirty from walkin' the street
With your old hurdy gurdy, no one to meet
Say love ain't the same on the south side of town
You could look but you ain't gonna find it around

It's the same old story
Same old song and dance, my friend
It's the same old story
Same old story, same old song and dance I hear you talking when I'm on the street
Your mouth don't move but I can hear you speak

What's the matter with the boy?
He don't come around no more
Is he checking out for sure?
Is he gonna close the door on me?

I'm always hearing voices on the street
I want to shout, but I can't hardly speak

I was making love last night
To a dancer friend of mine
I can't seem to stay in step
'Cause she come ev'ry time that she pirouettes over me

And I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping

I'm zipping through the days at lightning speed
Plug in, flush out and fire the fuckin' feed

Heading for the overload
Splattered on the dirty road
Kick me like you've kicked before
I can't even feel the pain no more

But I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming (only get them off)
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping (only get them off)

Feel so hypnotized, can't describe the scene
It's all mesmerized all that inside me

The sunshine bores the daylights out of me
Chasing shadows moonlight mystery

Headed for the overload
Splattered on the dirty road
Kick me like you've kicked before
I can't even feel the pain no more

But I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming (only get them off, get them off)
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping (only get them off, get them off)
And I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming (only get them off, get them off)
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping (only get them off, get them off)
I only get my socks off while I'm sleeping (only get them off, get them off)
(Only get them off, get them off) Well, someone told me yesterday
That when you throw your love away
You act as if you just don't care
You look as if you're going somewhere

But I just can't convince myself
I couldn't live with no one else
And I can only play that part
And sit and nurse my broken heart

So lonely, so lonely, so lonely, so lonely
So lonely, so lonely, so lonely
So lonely, so lonely, so lonely
So lonely, so lonely

Now no one's knocked upon my door
For a thousand years or more
All made up and nowhere to go
Welcome to this one-man show

Just take a seat, they're always free
No surprise, no mystery
In this theatre that I call my soul
I always play the starring role

So lonely, so lonely, so lonely, so lonely
So lonely, so lonely, so lonely
So lonely, so lonely, so lonely
So lonely, so lonely

So lonely, so lonely, so lonely, so lonely
So lonely, so lonely, so lonely

I feel lonely, oh so lonely
I feel so alone
I feel low
I feel so, feel so low
I feel low, low
I feel low, low, low
I feel low, low, low
I feel low, low, low
I feel low, low, low
I feel low, low, low
Low, I feel low
I feel low
I feel low
I feel so lonely
I feel so lonely
I feel so lonely, lonely, lonely, lone
Lonely, lone
I feel so alone, yeah

So lonely Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
You don't have to worry 'cause I'm coming
Back to where I should have always stayed
And now I've heard the maybe to your story
And it's enough love for me to stay

Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at

I wanna, wanna be where you are
Anywhere you are
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Everywhere you are

Please don't close the door to our future
There's so many things we haven't tried
I could love you better than I used to
And give you all the love I have inside

I wanna, wanna be where you are
Any, any, anywhere you are
I wanna, wanna be where you are
I gotta be where you are It is your character
Deep in your nature
Take one example
Sample and hold
Romance and replace
The lack in yourself
It's your nature
It's your nature
We see you climbing
Improving the effort
Wearing my suit
It is your character
There is a limit
Over your shoulder
Everyone loves you
Until they know you
Perfume aerosols
May champion the strangers
Nick
Standing around
All the right people
Crawling
Tennis on Tuesday
The ladder is long
It is your nature
You've gotta suntan
Football on Sunday
Society boy
On Social Security
It is your nature
Tennis on Tuesday
Sipping champagne
Football on Sunday
Home on the train
It is your nature
Girl from Totteridge Park
Said you were nice
So was my suit
The ladder is long Spoken Intro:
You ever want something
That you know you shouldn't have
The more you know you shouldn't have it,
The more you want it
And then one day you get it,
It's so good too
But it's just like my girl
When she's around me
I just feel so good, so good
But right now I just feel cold, so cold
Right down to my bones
'Cause ooh...
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away

I know, I know, I know, I know,
I know, know, know, know, know,
I know, I know,
Hey I ought to leave
I ought to leave her alone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
