Feels right - so fine
I'm yours - you're mine
Like paradise

I'd give you the world if it was mine

Feels fine

Feels like - you're mine

Give you the world if it was mine
Blow you right to my door
Feels fine

Feels like - you're mine
Feels right - so fine
I'm yours - you're mine
Like paradise

There goes my old girlfriend
There's another diamond ring
And all those late night promises
I guess they don't mean a thing

So baby, what's the story?
Did you find another man?
Is it easy to sleep in the bed that we made?
When you don't look back I guess the feelings start to fade away

I used to feel your fire
But now it's cold inside
And you're back on the street
Like you didn't miss a beat, yeah

Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was good
In your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me what it takes to let you go, yeah

Girl, before I met you
I was F-I-N-E, fine
But your love made me a prisoner
Yeah, my heart's been doin' time

Spent me up like money
Then you hung me out to dry
It was easy to keep all your lies in disguise
'Cause you had me in deep with the devil in your eyes

Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was good
In your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me what it takes to let you go

Guitar

And tell me that you're happy that you're on your own, yeah yeah yeah
Tell me that it's better when you're all alone
Tell me that your body doesn't miss my touch
Tell me that my lovin' didn't mean that much
Tell me you were lyin' when you cried for me

Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was good
In your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me who's to blame for thinking twice, no no no no
'Cause I don't wanna burn in paradise

Ooh
I don't, I don't
I don't wanna wanna burn in paradise
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go

Ahh, ahh, ahh
Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
Ooh yeah You consider me the young apprentice
Caught between the Scylla and Charybdis
Hypnotized by you if I should linger
Staring at the ring around your finger
I have only come here seeking knowledge
Things they would not teach me of in college
I can see the destiny you sold
Turned into a shining band of gold

I'll be wrapped around your finger
I'll be wrapped around your finger

Mephistopheles is not your name
I know what you're up to just the same
I will listen hard to your tuition
You will see it come to its fruition

I'll be wrapped around your finger
I'll be wrapped around your finger

Devil and the deep blue sea behind me
Vanish in the air, you'll never find me
I will turn your face to alabaster
When you find your servant is your master

You'll be wrapped around my finger
You'll be wrapped around my finger
You'll be wrapped around my finger Oh no
Oh no
Oh no

You'll never make me stay 
So take your weight off of me 
I know your every move 
So won't you just let me be 
I've been here times before 
But I was too blind to see 
That you seduce every man 
This time you won't seduce me 

She's saying that's ok 
Hey baby do what you please 
I have the stuff that you want 
I am the thing that you need 
She looked me deep in the eyes 
She's touching me so to start 
She says there's no turning back 
She's trapped me in her heart 

Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Let me be!

Oh no
Oh no
Oh no

She likes the boys in the band 
She knows when they come to town 
Every musician's fan 
After the curtain comes down 
She waits at backstage doors 
For those who have prestige 
Who promise fortune and fame 
A life that's so carefree 

She's saying that's ok 
Hey baby do what you want 
I'll be your night loving thing 
I'll be the freak you can taunt 
I don't care what you say 
I want to go too far 
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star

Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana . . .
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana . . .
Diana!
Diana!
Dirty Diana!
Dirty Dia . . .aa . . .aa . . .come on!

She said I have to go home 
'Cause I'm real tired, you see 
Now I hate sleeping alone
Why don't you come with me
I said my baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight 
I didn't call on the phone 
To say that I'm alright 

Diana walked up to me
She said I'm all yours tonight
At that I ran to the phone
Saying "Baby, I'm alright"
I said but unlock the door
'Cause I forgot the key
She said he's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me 

Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana

Boy what will it be Listen to me, I know what I'm saying
But Lord it don't come easy
To admit that I was wrong
It took me far too long
I counted on you
To give me a reason
Why the sun don't shine in the season
Gray sky surrounded me.

I'm not some kind of foolish lover
I couldn't take this from no other
You're not being cool with me
'Cause I always know you'll come back to me
Yes, you'll come back to me.

'Cause I always know
What it takes to make you my lover.

You once said to me that I was a cruel man
And you know that I almost believed you
I was blind, and I couldn't see
You took my sight from me.

And all of these words
And all this emotion
Can't explain my hopeless devotion
Or change what had to be.

I'm not some kind of foolish lover
I couldn't take this from no other
You're not being cool with me
'Cause I always know that you'll come back to me
Yes, you'll come back to me
Yes, you'll come back to me.

I'm not some kind of foolish lover
I couldn't take this from no other
You're not being cool with me
'Cause I always know that you'll come back to me
Yes, you'll come back to me.

I'm not some kind of foolish lover
I couldn't take this from another
It's no good being cool with me
'Cause I always know
What it takes to make you my lover. Keep me alive
Only you can do it
If not you'll die too
And I'll see to it

It's hard to survive
Don't know if I can do it

Keep me alive
I can't accept my fate
I need help
Before it's too late

It's hard to survive
Don't know if I can do it
I need to belong
I need to hang on
I need, need

Keep me alive
Feelings I must obey
Can't turn my eyes from the past
This crisis is the last

It's hard to survive
Don't know if I can do it

Keep me alive
I rely on your judgement
I've got none left of my own
Don't know what I'm doing

It's hard to survive
Don't know if I can do it
I need to belong
I need to hang on
I need, need

Keep me alive
Only you can do it
Keep me alive
Only you can do it

It's hard to survive
Don't know if I can do it

Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive

It's hard to survive
Don't know if I can do it
I need to belong
I need to hang on

You're jealous again
You're jealous again
You're jealous again
And again and again This is a crisis I knew had to come, destroying the balance I'd kept
Doubting, unsettling and turning around, wondering what will come next
Is this the role that you wanted to live? I was foolish to ask for so much
Without the protection and infancy's guard, it all falls apart at first touch

Watching the reel as it comes to a close, brutally taking its time
People who change for no reason at all, it's happening all of the time
Can I go on with this train of events disturbing and purging my mind?
Back out of my duties, when all's said and done. I know that I'll lose every time

Moving along in our God-given ways, safety is sat by the fire
Sanctuary from these feverish smiles, left with a mark on the door
Is this the gift that I wanted to give? Forgive and forget's what they teach
Or pass through the deserts and wastelands once more and watch as they drop by the beach

This is the crisis I knew had to come, destroying the balance I'd kept
Turning around to the next set of lives, wondering what will come next There's a little black spot on the sun today
It's the same old thing as yesterday
There's a black hat caught in a high tree top
There's a flag pole rag and the wind won't stop

I have stood here before inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles running 'round my brain
I guess I'm always hoping that you'll end this reign
But it's my destiny to be the king of pain

There's a little black spot on the Sun today (that's my soul up there)
It's the same old thing as yesterday (that's my soul up there)
There's a black hat caught in a high tree top (that's my soul up there)
There's a flag pole rag and the wind won't stop (that's my soul up there)

I have stood here before inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles running 'round my brain
I guess I'm always hoping that you'll end this reign
But it's my destiny to be the king of pain

There's a fossil that's trapped in a high cliff wall (that's my soul up there)
There's a dead salmon frozen in a waterfall (that's my soul up there)
There's a blue whale beached by a springtide's ebb (that's my soul up there)
There's a butterfly trapped in a spider's web (that's my soul up there)

I have stood here before inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles running 'round my brain
I guess I'm always hoping that you'll end this reign
But it's my destiny to be the king of pain

There's a king on a throne with his eyes torn out
There's a blind man looking for a shadow of doubt
There's a rich man sleeping on a golden bed
There's a skeleton choking on a crust of bread

King of pain

There's a red fox torn by a huntsman's pack (that's my soul up there)
There's a black winged gull with a broken back (that's my soul up there)
There's a little black spot on the sun today
It's the same old thing as yesterday

I have stood here before inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles running 'round my brain
I guess I'm always hoping that you'll end this reign
But it's my destiny to be the king of pain

King of pain
King of pain
King of pain
I'll always be king of pain
I'll always be king of pain
I'll always be king of pain
I'll always be king of pain
I'll always be king of pain
I'll always be king of pain Ooh, baby
Anytime my world gets crazy
All I have to do to calm it
Is just think of you

'Cause when I think of you, baby
Nothin' else seems to matter
'Cause when I think of you, baby
All I think about is our love

I just get
More attached to you when
You hold me in your arms and squeeze me
And you leave me, makin' me blue

'Cause then I think of you, baby
Nothin' else seems to matter
'Cause when I think of you, baby
All I think about is our love

So in love (so in love)
Ooh (so in love)
With you (so in love)
Baby (so in love)
Ooh (so in love)
Hee (so in love)
With you (so in love)
(So in love)

When I think of you (when I think of you)
When I think of you (when I think of you)
Bass

I'm so in love
I just think of you
If you're not around, I'm
When I think of you

 (So in love)
Ooh (so in love)
So in love (so in love)
With you (so in love)
Baby, you (so in love)
Ooh (so in love)
So in love (so in love)
With you (so in love)

Hahahaha
Feels so good
When I think of you
Yeah, yeah
Baby The innocence of sleeping children dressed in white and slowly dreaming stops all time
I slow my steps and start to blur, so many years have filled my heart, I never thought I'd say those words

(The further we go and older we grow, the more we know, the less we show
The further we go and older we grow, the more we know, the less we show)

The very first time I saw your face I thought of a song and quickly changed the tune
The very first time I touched your skin I thought of a story and rushed to reach the end too soon
Oh, remember. Oh, please don't change

So the fall came, thirteen years, a shiny ring and how I could forget your name
The air no longer in my throat, another perfect lie is choked but it always feels the same

So they close together, dressed in red and yellow, innocent forever. Sleeping children in their blue soft rooms still dream

(The further we go and older we grow, the more we know, the less we show
The further we go and older we grow, the more we know, the less we show) This fucking city is run by pigs
They take the rights away from all the kids

Understand we're fighting a war we can't win
They hate us, we hate them
We can't win, no way

Walk down the street, I flip them off
They hit me across the head with a billy club

Understand we're fighting a war we can't win
They hate us, we hate them

Nothing I do, nothing I say
I tell them to go get fucked, they put me away

Understand we're fighting a war we can't win
They hate us, we hate them
We can't win, no way

Those fuckers are gonna pay
Those fuckers are gonna pay

I go to court for my crime
Stand in line, pay bail, I may serve time

Understand we're fighting a war we can't win
They hate us, we hate them
We can't win, no way Ooh

I worry that the caller might have awful news, oh my
Who knows these days where on earth all the money goes, oh yeah
No doubt we could put it to a better use, oh my

You keep insisting that nobody showed you how to keep relationships, oh yeah
Your daddy made a real good try, oh my
You said you knew all along we could work it out, oh yeah
Do you have to make a fuss every time we fly

I'm looking for clues

I'll have to make an effort now just to be serious, oh yeah
Nobody's gonna give you the benefit of the doubt, oh my
Every time I pick a paper up it's harder to believe the news, oh yeah
I'm gonna have to shake it up and twist and shout, oh my

But if you don't put faith in what you believe in
It's getting you nowhere
'Cos it hurts, you never let go
Don't look down, just look up
Cos she's always there to behind you, just to remind you

Two hearts, believing in just one mind
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind

'Cos there's no easy way to, to understand it
There's so much of my life in her, and it's like I'm blinded
And it teaches you to never let go
There's so much love you'll never know
She can reach you no matter how far
Wherever you are

Two hearts, believing in just one mind
Beating together till the end of time
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
Together forever till the end of time

She knows (she knows)
There'll always be a special place in my heart for her
She knows, she knows, she knows
Yeah, she knows (she knows)
No matter how far apart we are
She knows, I'm always right there beside her

We're two hearts, believing in just one mind
Beating together till the end of time
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
Together forever till the end of time

You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
Together forever, til the end of time

I push a pen until half past ten
I watch the clock there on the wall
Tic toc, why don't you call
The boss come in and walks down the aisles
He turns around but he never smiles
He watches me just like a hawk
And then he says we must talk

You move me, from side to side
You move me and if feels so right
You move me up and down
You move me around and around

Son, he says (what) I've got bad news
Life is hard and you got the blues
I know you're good and I know you work hard
I'm sorry, son, but here are your cards
I went home and kicked off my shoes
And I asked myself why do I always lose
But then you called and everything was fine
I'm so glad that you are mine

You move me, from side to side
You move me and if feels so right
You move me up and down
You move me around and around

You're the one thing in my life
That makes me feel so good inside
Will you hold me tight tonight
Oh, girl I wish you would decide

You move me, from side to side
You move me and if feels so right
You move me up and down
You move me around and around I'm driving home for Christmas
Oh, I can't wait to see those faces
I'm driving home for Christmas, yeah
Well, I'm moving down that line

And it's been so long
But I will be there
I sing this song
To pass the time away

Driving in my car
Driving home for Christmas

It's gonna take some time
But I'll get there
Top to toe in tailbacks
Oh, I got red lights all around
But soon there'll be a freeway, yeah
Get my feet on holy ground

So I sing for you
Though you can't hear me
When I get through
And feel you near me

Driving in my car
I'm driving home for Christmas
Driving home for Christmas
With a thousand memories

I take look at the driver next to me
He's just the same
Just the same

You give me the reason
You give me control
I gave you my purity
My purity you stole

Did you think I wouldn't recognize this compromise?
Am I just too stupid to realize?
Stale incense, old sweat
And lies, lies, lies

It comes down to this
Your kiss, your fist
And your strain, it gets under my skin
Within, take in
The extent of my sin

You give me the anger
You give me the nerve
Carry out my sentence
Well, I get what I deserve

I'm just an effigy to be disgraced, to be defaced
Your need for me has been replaced
And if I can't have everything
Well, then just give me a taste

It gets under my skin

I was borne from original sin
And if I had a dollar bill for all the things I've done
There'd be a mountain of money piled up to my chin, hey

My mother told me good, my mother told me strong
She said, "Be true to yourself and you can't go wrong.
But there's just one thing that you must understand.
You can fool with your brother
But don't mess with a missionary man.
Don't mess with a missionary man
Don't mess with a missionary man
Don't mess with a missionary man."

Oh, the missionary man, he's got God on his side
He's got the saints and apostles backing up from behind
Black eyed looks from those Bible books
He's a man with a mission, got a serious mind

There was a woman in the jungle and a monkey on a tree
The missionary man, he was following me
He said, "Stop what you're doing, get down upon your knees.
I've a message for you that you better believe."

Ah yeah
Hey
Uh
Hey, uh

Well I was born an original sinner
I was borne from original sin
And if I had a dollar bill for all the things I've done
There'd be a mountain of money

Don't mess with a missionary man

Gentlemen gentlemen please!
Can you please support the notion
Of what I'm saying here
That the person here in question
Must be an angel here on earth
If they can't see a human being
For what a human being's really worth
Gentlemen please!

Ah the first summer of love was clearly just a summer long
And there was Jesus on the radio
Jesus on the train...
Jesus in the calico
Jesus in the rain
And there was love love love love
Anyone could see that there was love
Love all over me

Ah the second summer of love is here so tell your angry friends
To throw away their Gaultier and grow their hair again.

Acid on the radio
Acid on the rain...
Acid in the calico
Acid in the rain.

And there was love love love love
Anyone could see that there was love
Love all over me

There was love love love love love...
Anyone could see that there was love
Love all over me.

There was love all over the country
And there was love all over the world.

Acid on the radio, acid on the brain, acid everywhere you go,
Acid in the rain.

And there was love love love love, anyone could see that there was love
Love all over me.
The was love, love, love, love, love
Anyone could see that there was love
Love all over me. As a tear fades away
And the dawn dries a lover's eyes
No more tears, they're all gone
Just believe it will always be

My heart in your hand
Knows that all this belongs to me
And like the child here I stay
While your heart sings inside of me

One dream of my live
One night in eternity
The wind whispered soft to me
And heaven stood still

One sigh of the dawn
Sweet instant of memory
One celestial rhapsody
And heaven stood still Now
Now pay no heed
Don't care for you

My hummingbird and have you heard
That I thought my life, it had ended
But I find it has just begun

'Cause she gets me where I live
I'll give all I have to give
I'm talking about that hummingbird

Oh she's little and she loves me
It's too much for words to say
When I see her in the morning sleeping

She's little and she loves me, yes she does
It's gonna be my lucky day
Hummingbird, don't fly away

When I'm feeling wild and lonesome
She knows the words, she's gotta know the words to say
And she gives me a little of her understanding
In her special way
And I have to say

In my life I'll love no other
Because she's more, more, more, much more than I deserve
And she gets me where I live
I'll give her all I have to give
I'm talking about, oh, my hummingbird

Oh, she's little and she loves me
Too much for words to say
