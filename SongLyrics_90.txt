 Diamonds, roses I need Moses
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain
I don't necessarily buy any key to the future or happiness
But I need a little place in the sun sometimes or I think I will die

But everywhere is somewhere and nowhere is near
Everybody got somebody with their wine and their beer
So I'm just this tragic figure in the corner over here
With an empty apartment and a best friend who is a queer

Every time I see him he smiles 
And tells me how well he is walking these miles
But he never ever asks a single thing about me
If I die he'd hear about it eventually

Diamonds, roses I need Moses
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain

An everywhere is somewhere and nowhere is near
Everybody got somebody with their wine and their beer
So I'm just this tragic figure in the corner over here
Go home to an empty apartment and call a best friend who is queer

Diamonds, roses, I need Moses
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain, of pain You hear me so clearly
And see how I try
So you feel me, So heal me
And tear me apart

And I won't tell a soul
I won't tell at all
And do they have to know, do they have to know
About my Goodnight Girl

Caught up in your wishing well
Your hopes inside it
Take your love and promises
And make them last
You make them last, make them last, make them last

You keep me so near you
And see me so far
And hold me and send me
And deep in your heart

And I won't tell a soul (I won't tell a soul)
I won't tell at all (I won't tell at all)
And I won't let them know (I won't let them know)
About my Goodnight Girl

Caught up in your wishing well
Your hopes inside it
Take your love and promises
And make them last
You make them last
Caught up in your wishing well
Your hopes inside it
Take your love and promises
And make them last
You make them last

Doesn't matter how sad
I made ya
Doesn't matter how hard
I try

Just remember the same
Old reason
Reflected in your eyes
You said you wanted me, hmmm

Caught up in your wishing well
Your hopes inside it
Take your love and promises
And make them last
You make them last
Caught up in your wishing well
Your hopes inside it
Take your love and promises
And make them last
You make them last Lisa's kissing men like a long walk home
When the music stops
Take a tip from me, don't go through the park
When you're on your own it's a long walk home

Well, if they follow you
Don't look back
Like Dylan in the movies
On your own
If they follow you
It's not your money that they're after, boy, it's you

Pure easy listening, settle down
On the pillow soft when they've all gone home
You can concentrate on the ones you love
You can concentrate, hey, now they've gone

But if they follow you
Don't look back
Like Dylan in the movies
On your own
If they follow you
It's not your money that they're after, boy, it's you

Yeah, you're worth the trouble and you're worth the pain
And you're worth the worry, I would do the same
If we all went back to another time
I will love you over
I will love you over
I will love you

If they follow you
Don't look back
Like Dylan in the movies
On your own
If they follow you
Tenderly you turn the light off in your room

If they follow you
Don't look back
Like Dylan in the movies
On your own
If they follow you The islander slips into hiding
And takes to his heels
Out of dark Northland
The murky house of Sara
He whirled out of doors as snow
Arrives as smoke in the yard
To flee from bad deeds

There he had to become someone else
He must change his shape
As an eagle he swept up
Wanted to soar heavenward
The sun burnt his cheeks
The moon lit his brows Waiting
To be born again
Wanting
The saddest kind of pain
Waiting for the day
When I will crawl away

Nothing
Is what I feel
Waiting
For the drugs to make it real
Waiting for the day
When I will crawl away

Waiting
To be disciplined
Aching
For your nails across my skin
Waiting for the day
When I will crawl
Waiting for the day
When I will crawl away Sunny came home to her favorite room
Sunny sat down in the kitchen
She opened a book and a box of tools
Sunny came home with a mission

She says "Days go by, I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire"

Sunny came home with a list of names
She didn't believe in transcendence
And it's time for a few small repairs, she said
Sunny came home with a vengeance

She says "Days go by, I don't know why 
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire"

Get the kids and bring a sweater
Dry is good and wind is better
Count the years, you always knew it
Strike a match, go on and do it

Oh, days go by, I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire

Oh, light the sky and hold on tight
The world is burning down
She's out there on her own, and she's all right
Sunny came home

Sunny came home
Came home
Home Hit you from behind
She messed up all you though you stood for
Never had a rollercoaster so unkind
Creeping up and then rushing down so fast
Screaming loud
All the time ignoring all my...

Questions, pressures to say
What you should say
How you feel today

And I'll force out a smile
A smile that hides behind it
A hand that wants to punch a smile into you

You reeled so surprised when her love went tumbling all around you
Tried to hide from you just how well I'd understand
You retreated into a world where I caused the pain
All the time ignoring all my...

Questions, pressures to see
What you should see
What you mean to me

But I'll force out a smile
A smile that hates the things you do

If I could shout, if I could dream
If I could tell the things you dream
If I could draw a picture for you
Of how I feel
The words would fall around your ears

And I'll force out a smile
A smile that hides behind it
A hand that wants to hold you tightly to me I may run and hide when you're screamin' my name, alright
But let me tell you now, there are prices to fame, alright
All of our time spent in flashes of light

All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality?
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life, alright

Looking at the crowd and I see your body sway, c'mon
Wishin' I could thank you in a different way, c'mon
'Cause all of your time spent keeps us alive

All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality?
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

Larger than life
Yeah, that's right
All of your time spent keeps us alive, yeah
Every time we're down, you can make it right

All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality?
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

Yeah, every time we're down
Yeah, you can make it right
Yeah, that's what makes you larger than life, yeah

All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality?
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger, that makes you larger
Than makes you larger than life, yeah DEL made a pact to be well natural
Back from the wishing well to sell actual
Funk from the fungus grown in the trench
It's getting kinda heavy so I gotta pinch an inch
And it's a snitch

To let my hair grow like a plant
Eliminate the fat gold chains and the diaper pants
Trade 'em for a pair Girbauds
Never make friends with the fraudulent foes

Yes I suppose that I'm fat from the supper
Skinny from the many that try to eat plenty
Now I got to flip on a copper like a penny
Vise uh versa, quench your thirst

With a swig of grapefruit juice straight from the thermos
Hock your jewels, and you can drop your tools
And make a move that can turn us in the right direction
Show your affection as I correct men

Who try to pull the wool over the third eye
Comin' fly with Mr. Greenjeans
It's a bird eye view of the meadow
As I greet the many people that I meet with a hello

"How do you do my compadre?", What up Kwame?
Back to the Meadow so I can show I'm a
Smooth black brother that is gifted
And if you try to lift this, yes, I got a witness
Nicknamed the Emperor, this wasn't meant for ya'

Ya little crumbsnatcher Cada día pienso en ti
Pienso un poco más en ti
Despedazo mi razón
Se destruye algo de mí
Cada día pienso en ti
Pienso un poco más en ti

Cada día pienso en ti
Pienso un poco más en ti
Cada vez que sale el sol
Busco en algo el valor 
Para continuar así
Y te veo así no te toque
Rezo por ti cada noche
Amanece y pienso en ti
Y retumba en mis oídos 
El tictac de los relojes
Y sigo pensando en ti

Y sigo pensando.....

Translation:
Everyday, I think of you. 
I think a bit more of you 
I take apart my heart... 
Something in me is destroyed... 
Everyday I think of you. 
I think a bit more of you... 
Everytime that the sun comes out 
I look for a bit of valor 
to continue. 


And I see you, I didn't touch you that way. 
I pray for you every night... 
It dawns and I think of you. 
And it rumbles in my ears 
the tick-tock of the clocks 
and I keep thinking of you 
and I keep thinking..... I'm in the sky tonight
There I can keep by your side
Watching the wide world riot and hiding out
I'll be coming home next year

Into the sun we climb
Climbing our wings will burn white
Everyone strapped in tight
We'll ride it out
I'll be coming home next year

Come on get on, get on
Take it till life runs out
No one can find us now
Living with our heads underground

Into the night we shine
Lighting the way we glide by
Catch me if I get too high
When I come down
I'll be coming home next year

I'm in the sky tonight
There I can keep by your side
Watching the whole world wind around and round
I'll be coming home next year

Come on get on, get on
Take it till life runs out
No one can find us now
Living with our heads underground

I'll be coming home next year
I'll be coming home next year
Everything's alright up here
If I come down
I'll be coming home next year

Say goodbye, say goodbye
Say goodbye, say goodbye
I'll be coming home next year
I'll be coming home next year
Everything's alright up here
If I come down
I'll be coming home next year
I'll be coming home next year I heard from a friend today
And she said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back to me
In my mind

How can I be strong?
I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions you had many
I know you did

I come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
Never fall again

Making love to you felt so good
And oh so right

How can I be strong?
I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

So here we are alone again
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss

I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
Don't think I can take the pain
Never fall again

Kinda late in the game
And my heart is in your hands
Don't you stand there and then tell me
You love me, then leave again
'Cause I'm falling in love with you again

Hold me, hold me
Don't ever let me go
Say it just one time
Say you love me
God knows I do love you again <span style="padding:1em"><img alt="TrebleClef" class="lzy lzyPlcHld" data-image-key="TrebleClef.png" data-image-name="TrebleClef.png" data-src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/lyricwiki/images/1/1e/TrebleClef.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/30?cb=20090423154754" height="68" onload="if(typeof ImgLzy==='object'){ImgLzy.load(this)}" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" width="30"/><noscript><img alt="TrebleClef" class="" data-image-key="TrebleClef.png" data-image-name="TrebleClef.png" height="68" src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/lyricwiki/images/1/1e/TrebleClef.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/30?cb=20090423154754" width="30"/></noscript></span> Instrumental Frozen in the place I hide
Not afraid to paint my sky with
Some who say I've lost my mind
Brother try and hope to find

You were always so far away
I know that pain so don't you run away
Like you used to do

Roses in a vase of white
Bloodied by the thorns beside the leaves
That fall because my hand is
Pulling them hard as I can

You were always so far away
I know that pain
So I won't run away like I used to do

Pictures in a box at home
Yellowing and green with mold
So I can barely see your face
Wonder how that color taste

You were always so far away
I know the way so don't you run away
Like you used to do Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario
Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario

Ayo, Bo knows this (what) and Bo knows that (what)
But Bo don't know jack, cause Bo can't rap
Well what do you know, the Di-Dawg is first up to bat
No batteries included, and no strings attached
No holds barred, no time for move faking
Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon
Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe so
Sleep if you want, NyQuil will help you get your Z's, troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some, short, dark and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fuming, I've had it up to here
My days of paying dues are over, acknowledge me as in there (yeah)
Head for the border, go get a taco
Watch me wreck it from the jump street, meaning from the get-go
Sit back, relax and let yourself go
Don't front what you heard, but act like you know

Yes yes, y'all (yes y'all)
Who got the vibe, it's the Tribe y'all (Tribe y'all)
Real live, y'all (live y'all)
Inside, outside, come around
(Who's that) Brown
Some may, I say, call me Charlie
The word is the herb and I'm deep like Bob Marley
Lay back on the payback, evolve, rotate the gates
(Contact) Can I get a hit (hit)
Boom bip with a brother named Tip, and we're ready to flip
East coast stomping, ripping and romping
New York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton
Checka-checka-check it out
The loops for the troops, more bounce to the ounce
And wow how now wow how now, Brown cow
We're ill till the skill gets down
For the flex, next, it's the textbook old to the new
But the rest are doo-doo
From radio to the video to Arsenio
Tell me, yo, what's the scenario

(True blue) Scooby Doo, whoopie doo
Scenarios, radios, rates more than four
Scores for the smores that smother dance floors
Now I go for mine, shades of seashore
Ship-shape crushed grapes, apes that play tapes
Papes make drakes, baked for the wakes
Of an L-ah, and -eader, simply just a leader
Bass in the space means "peace, see ya later"
Later (later), later alligator
Pop blows the weasel and the herb's the inflator
So yo, the D what the O, incorporate I-N-C into a flow
Funk flipped flat back first this foul fight fight fight
Laugh yo, how'd that sound (ooh)

It's a Leader Quest mission and we got the goods here (here)
Never on the left cause my right's my good ear (ear)
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal
Stay away from crime so I ain't no criminal
I love my young nation, groovy sensation
No time for hibernation, only elation
Don't ever try to test the water, little kid
Yo Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell 'em what I did

I heard you rushed and rushed, and attacked
Then they rebuked, then you had to smack
Causing rambunction throughout the sphere
Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear

You know I did it
So don't violate or you'll get violated
The hip-hop sound is well agitated
Won't ever waste no time on the played out ego
So here's Busta Rhymes with the scenario

Watch as I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come rewind
Powerful impact (boom) from the cannon
Not bragging, try to read my mind, just imagine
Vocabulary's necessary
When digging into my library
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh
Eating Ital Stew like the one Peter Tosh
Uh, uh, uh, all over the track, man
Uh, pardon me, uh, as I come back
As I did it, yo I heard you beg your pardon
When I travel through the town, I roll with the squadron
Roar, roar, like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers cause your pants are sagging
Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban
And have you smelling ripe like some old stale urine
Chickity-choco, the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel, butt cheeks they were kicking
Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme
The rhythm is in sync (uh) the rhymes are on time (time)
Ripping up this dance just like Horatio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario
Yeah, my man, motherafucka

Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario
Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario

Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario
Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario He spent his whole life bein' too young
To live the life that's in his dreams
At night he lies awake and he wonders
"Why can't that be me?"

'Cause in his life he's filled with all these good intentions
He's left a lot of things he'd rather not mention right now
Just before he says goodnight
He looks up with a little smile at me and he says

If I can be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day
In those shoes
If I can be like that, what would I do?
What would I do? Yeah

Now in dreams we run

She spends her days up in the north park
Watching the people as they pass
And all she wants is just a little piece of this dream
Is that too much to ask?
With a safe home and a warm bed on a quiet little street
All she wants is just that something to hold on to
That's all she needs, yeah

If I can be like that 
I would give anything
Just to live one day
In those shoes
If I can be like that, what would I do?
What would I do? Yeah

I'm falling into this, in dreams we run away

If I can be like that 
I would give anything
Just to live one day
In those shoes
If I can be like that, what would I do?
What would I do?

If I can be like that 
I would give anything
Just to live one day
In those shoes
If I can be like that, what would I do?
What would I do?

If I can be like that 
I would give anything
Just to live one day
In those shoes
If I can be like that, what would I do?
What would I do?

Find another way
Ohohoho
Find another, another way)

(Find another way to me
Find another way and make me free
Can you hear my voice so find another way
Oh, I cried to you, please, follow me oh, follow me)

(Ohohoho
Find another way
Ohohoho
Find another, another way)

(Find another, another way)

Shake it, break it, no, I can't fake it
To another level, can't take it
Pressurize and hypnotize
And in your mind, realize

And move, move, no I gotta move
Yo, so, watch me groove
Beat to the beat, fire and heat
Make you jump right outta your seat

Gotta jam, jam, watch me jam
To the beat, yo, watch me slam
Pumpin', pumpin', looking for something
Always question leaving nothing

Shake it, shake it every day
Keeping busy day by day
To find, to find another way

(Find another way to me
Find another way and make me free
Can you hear my voice so find another way
Oh, I cried to you, please, follow me oh, follow me)

(Ohohoho
Find another way
Ohohoho
Find another, another way)

(Find another, another way)

Weekdays morning, always holding
Got to be studying, I'm rolling
Project on the dancefloor
Working where you're going

But certainly no way out
No way out, gonna make you pride
No doubt respect, what I'm looking for
Weekday on, now hit the door

Faster, faster, making it faster
Turn it loud, sweep your blaster
Bust the sound you've found
Keepin' the thunder underground

Keep the bass is what I say
Keepin' it pumpin', day by day to find
To find another way

(Find another way to me
Find another way and make me free
Can you hear my voice so find another way
Oh, I cried to you, please, follow me oh, follow me)
(Ohohoho
Find another way
Ohohoho
Find another, another way)

(Ohohoho
Find another way
Ohohoho
Find another, another way)

(Ohohoho
Find another way
Ohohoho
Find another, another way) Anything is what she is
Anywhere is where she's from
Anything is what she'll be
Anything as long as it's mine

And the door it opened a way back in
Or is it way back out?

Any place is where she'll be
Any place she'll see you from
Lies and secrets become your world
Anytime, anywhere, she takes me away

And death climbs up the steps one by one
To give you the rose that's been burned by her son

Point me to the sky above
I can't get there on my own
Walk me to the graveyard
Dig up her bones

I have seen the demon's face
I have heard of her death place
I fall down on my knees
In praise of the...
Horrible things that take her away

And death climbs up the steps one by one
To give you the rose that's been burned by her son

Point me to the sky above
I can't get there on my own
Walk me to the graveyard
Dig up her bones
Point me to the sky above
I can't get there on my own
Walk me to the graveyard
Dig up her bones
Bones Dirty your face
With longing and grace, God-given
Suffer her heart
And love her when your love goes unrequited
Where the cool winds blow
I must surely go
For my love calls me below to drag her
From the depths of my soul
When will I see her again?
The other side of friends
The darkened claws of death
The empty breath desire

Dirty your face
With longing and grace, God-given
Suffer her heart
And love her when your love goes unrequited
Restless in my speech
And ruthless in my teach
So vacant in my breach
I drive the dirt up her garden
Sorrow
She'll never listen again
No other lovers to bend
Just rotten apples to eat
Just letter yellowed distant scorn

Dirty your face
With longing and grace, God-given
Suffer her heart
And love her when your love goes unrequited
Life just fades away
Purity just begs
Dust to dust, we're wired into sadness I could be sleeping
I could be dreaming
I could have ordinary people chasing me from town to town
Mission Impossible
They've got a spy for every blink of your eye

I'm feeling awkward
I'm feeling tongue-tied
They've got a knife for every time you take the same train into work
A family's like a loaded gun
You point it in the wrong direction someone's gonna get killed

If you had such a dream
Would you get up and do the things you believed in?

Is he your husband?
Or just your boyfriend?
Is he the moron who's been beating you and keeping you inside?
I've never done this kind of thing
But if I kill him now, well who's going to miss him?

I went up to the school
I took a walk up Castlehill
For every step there was a local boy who wants to be a hero
Do you wanna do it now?
Outside the butcher's with a knife and a bike chain

If you had such a dream
Would you get up and do the things you believed in?

If you had such a dream
Would you get up and do those things?

If you had such a dream
Would you get up and do those things?

While your head is clear
While your head is clear
While your head is clear
While your head is clear

Woman speaking in background (from "Rip Van Winkle" by Washington Irving):

"Times grew worse and worse with Rip Van Winkle as years of matrimony rolled on; a tart tempter never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue is the only edge tool that grows keener by constant use. For a long while he used to console himself, when driven from home, by frequenting a kind of perpetual club of the sages, philosophers, and other idle personages of the village, which held its sessions on a bench before a small inn, designated by a rubicund portrait of his majesty George the Third. Here they used to sit in the shade, through a long lazy summer's day, talking listlessly over village gossip, or telling endless sleepy stories about nothing. But it would have been worth any statesman's money to have heard the profound discussions that sometimes took place, when by chance an old newspaper fell into their hands, from some passing traveller. How solemnly they would listen to the contents, as drawled out by Derrick Van Bummel, the schoolmaster, a dapper learned little man, who was not to be daunted by the most gigantic word in the dictionary..." Now the rain comes down the windows and it,
Drops onto the forehead of the waiting boy,
He surveys his rental kingdom and he,
Wonders if he's really lost his one joy.

Another fool would go down to the,
Only place she ever went to lose herself,
She's gone to the movies now and she,
Don't need your help.

Now the rain turns into snowfall as the,
City sky reflects the silver street below,
And it covers up the cars,
And the Wall-flowers CD ended half an hour ago.

Another fool would dig the broken car out from the snow,
And drive to find the show,
She's gone to the movies now and she's,
Not coming home,
She's gone to the movies now and she's,
Not coming home.

Now he looks around his place and anyways,
There's nowhere she could sit besides the bed,
And he wonders if the car will start tomorrow,
Or he'll have to take the bus instead.

Any other fool would be out on the roadway,
Trying to spot her rusted Pontiac,
She's gone to the movies now and she's,
Not coming back,
She's gone to the movies now and she's,
Not coming back. Master of disharmony
Welcome my tainted soul
Take me from the hordes of the living
Into the blessed darkness
Master of disharmony
Take my impure flesh
Lead me into the path of temptation
Save me from cowardness

Save me from cowardness

Master of sin
Take my cursed heart
Bring me where I can find salvation
For I am the damned

Master of death
Take my pitiful life
I am enslaved
I shall never forget the pain

Master of sin
Take my cursed heart
Bring me where I can find salvation
For I am the danmed

Master of death
Take my pitiful life
I am enslaved
I shall never forget the pain I am watching the rise and fall of my salvation 
There's so much shit around me 
Such a lack of compassion 
I thought it would be fun and games (it would be fun and games)
Instead, It's all the same (it's all the same)
I want something to do 
Need to feel the sickness in you 

I feel the reason as it's leaving me. 
No, not again 
It's quite deceiving as I'm feeling the flesh make me bad 

All I do is look for you 
I need my fix, you need it too 
Just to get some sort of attention, attention 
What does it mean to you? (what does it mean to you?)
For me, It's something I just do (I just do)
I want something 
I need to feel the sickness in you.

I feel the reason as it's leaving me. 
No, not again 
It's quite deceiving as I'm feeling the flesh make me bad 
I feel the reason as it's leaving me. 
No, not again 
It's quite deceiving as I'm feeling the flesh make me bad 

I feel the reason as it's leaving me. 
No, not again 
It's quite deceiving as I'm feeling the flesh make me bad.
(Does it make me bad?) 
I feel the reason as it's leaving me.
No, not again.
(Does it make me bad?)
It's quite deceiving as I'm feeling the flesh make me bad.

Does it make me bad?
Does it make me bad?
Does it make me bad?
Does it make me bad? Hit it

(C'mon, c'mon) To this world I'm unimportant
Just because I have nothing to give
So you call this your free country
Tell me why it costs so much to live
Tell me why

This world can turn me down
But I won't turn away, oh no
And I won't turn around

All my work and endless measures
Never seem to get me very far
Walk a mile just to move an inch now
Even though I'm trying so damn hard
I'm trying so hard

This world can turn me down
But I won't turn away
And I won't duck and run
'Cause I'm not built that way

When everything is gone
There's nothing there to fear
This world cannot bring me down
No, 'cause I am already here, oh no

I'm already here
Down on my knees
I'm already here, oh no
I'm already here
I must have told you a thousand times
I'm not running away

I won't duck and run
I won't duck and run
I won't duck and run
No, no, no, pass away

This world can turn me down
But I won't turn away
And I won't duck and run
'Cause I'm not built that way

When everything is gone
There's nothing there to fear
This world cannot bring me down
No, 'cause I am already here

This world can turn me down
But I won't turn away
And I won't duck and run
'Cause I'm not built that way

When everything is gone
There's nothing there to fear
This world cannot bring me down
No, 'cause I am already here I thought I'd begun, to see a change
But the more things change, the more they stay the same
Back stabbing and name calling, the trademarks of your act
You talk and talk of unity, but divide with your attacks

(You say)
I'd like to see a change
I'd like to see a change
I'd like to see a change, but I'm too busy...
Tearing everyone down
Tearing everyone down
Go!

All us kids, we try to make a change
Some kids start a band, others start a zine
YOU!, no matter what your path
You throw a curve in what could be achieved,
Then give up and move onto some other thing

(You say)
I'd like to see a change
I'd like to see a change
I'd like to see a change, but I'm too busy...
Tearing everyone down
Tearing everyone down

Take a break
From your fights,
Try to open your mind tonight
When you feel
That's complete
Then we can tackle this society!

You may not like
Everything in life I do...
But that doesn't mean
I'm not trying to change
The same problems as you

(You say)
I'd like to see a change
I'd like to see a change
I'd like to see a change, but I'm too busy...
Tearing everyone down
Tearing everyone down
Tearing everyone down (down!) down! (down!) down! (down!)
Tearing everyone down (down!) down! (down!) down! (down!)
Tearing everyone down Unfortunately, we are not licensed to display the full lyrics for this song at the moment. Hopefully we will be able to in the future.

Right now I'm just livin' it
Right now I'm just livin' it
Right now I'm just givin' it

Looking out over the multitude
Looking in to the heart of it
Reaching out into the middle of it
Seeing how we\'re a part of it

I'm feeling the tides of time
Moving in on my senses now
I'm feeling the tides of time
Pull me in, pull me out

Could be in the sun setting
Might be in the rise of a storm
Could be in the morning light
Must be in the moment you're born

Seems like human nature
Seems like the day to day
Seemed like a big hay ride
Started us out to find our way

Unofficial verse:
So hard so beautiful
Rushing out over eternity
So long that's the short of it
So short that's the long and the tall of it Remember me the way I was
The way I'd make you late for work
I had to hold you, just because

Remember you the way you'd wake me up
To love me once again
We were lovers, we were friends

But was I chasin' rainbows
Blinded by the sun
And did I take for granted
I'd be the only one?

I didn't know you were so lonely
Am I to blame for makin' you that way?
Did I neglect all that mattered?
With my head so far above
The clouds I didn't see
That it was raining on our love

Remember when, just to feel my touch
Was all you ever needed
Oh it used to be enough

Remember when love
Was a promise we would give our lives to keep
And no river ran as deep

But was I chasin' rainbows
Blinded by the sun
And did I take for granted
I'd be the only one?

I didn't know you were so lonely
Am I to blame for makin' you that way?
Did I neglect all that mattered?
With my head so far above
The clouds I didn't see
That it was raining on our love

I was taking all the love you had to give
But I was too lost in life to know
That without my love in return you could not live
Now she gives the love I did not show 

I didn't know you were so lonely
Am I to blame for makin' you that way?
Did I neglect all that mattered?
With my head so far above
The clouds I didn't see
That it was raining on our love I wish I was a neutron bomb, for once I could go off
I wish I was a sacrifice, but somehow still lived on
I wish I was a sentimental ornament you hung on
The Christmas tree, I wish I was the star that went on top

I wish I was the evidence, I wish I was the grounds
For fifty million hands upraised and open toward the sky

I wish I was a sailor with someone who waited for me
I wish I was as fortunate, as fortunate as me
I wish I was a messenger and all the news was good
I wish I was the full moon shining off your Camaro's hood

I wish I was an alien at home behind the sun
I wish I was the souvenir you kept your house key on
I wish I was the pedal brake that you depended on
I wish I was the verb "to trust" and never let you down

I wish I was a radio song, the one that you turned up Verse One: Big Boi

In the zone like Keyser Soze, always the Usual Suspect
No check, all I got in this game is my respect
And Southern pride I be, checkin' my fuckin' head
Scared, lookin' up in your face, boi I see dead
If you test like SAT, then I guess that we may be, enemies
In the P's freestyles be freebies
I be that wrong nigga to fuck with, wouldn't I
Wouldn't I be the wrong one to try, never eating chicken thighs
Only the twenty piece mojo, flow zone like Flo Jo
I wanted to figure out, just how low could yo' hoe go
The beat hit like Beat Street, Krush Groove and Breakin
Never bakin, rebukin Satan, we had you waitin
For the Second Coming funny how time flies when you're rhymin
La-Fa-Ce records, I think they got that perfect timin
To be doper than Sadaam believe the Nation of Islam
Fuck the police and the dogs, sniffin that dope up out your car
I think they overstep they boundaries
O.J., not guilty, that's how they found he

Verse Two: Andre

I felt the pressure like sun shinin, while raining at the same time
I kept on rhymin, not complainin
Storm bringing cats and dogs my catalog be the size of golf balls
Throw up your Daisy Dukes I'm Hazzard-ous to all you Boss Hoggs
And Roscoe P. Col' people, who could boost my locomotive
But enough of that everyone can rap unless they ain't supposed ta
I use my gift of gab to boast and brag in every rhyme I
Compose won't y'all get sick of that, 'cause I know I do when I hear those
Flows that ain't hip-hop, you find that shit in the gift shop
But to each his own, my speech is gon', keep that shit up outta my zone
Long as you happy then I'm happy
Even if you just hate my fuckin' guts go 'head and dap me
'Cause I'm gon' dap you anyway and then go home and pray for yo' ass later
'Cause we might need you in this war I'm wailin on you traitors
Like that... (What do your nipples look like?)

Wherever I go
I take a little piece of you
I collect
I reject
Photographs I took of you

Well towns I passed through
So many faces
So many places
I have got to have a memory
I have never been there
I have never been there

I have never had you
I have never had you
I have never had you
I have never had you
I have never had you
I have never had you

I can't remember
Give me your reminder
I can't remember
Give me your reminder
I collect
I reject

Memorabilia
Memorabilia
Memorabilia
Memorabilia

Key chains and snowstorms
The taste of your sweat
The look in your eye
I have been inside you
I have been inside you
I have been inside you
I have been inside you
I have been inside you
I have been inside you

I know what it feels like
I know what it feels like
I know what it feels like
I know what it feels like
I know what it feels like
I know what it feels like
(Wet as it is... the whiter the honey)

I collect
I reject

(Goodies come in here all day)

Give me your reminder
Give me your reminder
Give me your reminder

Give me your reminder
I can't remember

I collect

Memorabilia

Memorabilia
Memorabilia
Memorabilia
Memorabilia Here with me
And this price you pay
Just a wishful dream could be blown away
Ask yourself for better or worse
Because what's the use if it's just good luck
A black cat has crossed my path
Tell me what's good luck about that
Hate and greed
Swollen and sweet
Let's start this misery
If that's where you wanna be
Fear and love
From down or form up above
Come to me
Come to me
I bet you please
Come set me free
Excuse me please
For my definition
But deeper still are my convictions
Urgently I wait to hear an answer
While I misconduct
A sad lost anthem
An anthem like you have never heard
Have you heard something so absurd Why boasteth thyself, oh evil men
Playing smart and not being clever, oh no
I say, you're working iniquity
To achieve vanity, yeah, if I sow I sow
But the goodness of Jah, Jah
Indureth for Iver

If you are the big tree,
We are the small axe
Sharpened to cut you down (well sharp)
Ready to cut you down, oh yeah

These are the words of my Master
Keep on telling me
No weak heart shall prosper
Oh no, they can't, eh

And whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall fall in it, shall fall in it
Whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall bury in it, shall bury in it

If you are the big tree,
We are the small axe
Sharpened to cut you down
Ready to cut you down

And whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall fall in it, fall in it, eh
Whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall bury in it, shall bury in it

If you are the big tree,
We have a small axe
Ready to cut you down (well sharp)
Sharpened to cut you down

If you are the big tree, let me tell you this
We are the small axe
Ready to cut you down (well sharp)
Sharpened to cut you down Sacred
Holy
To put it in words
To write it down
That is walking on hallowed ground
I'm a missionary

So here is my confession
It's an obsession
I'm a firm believer
And a warm receiver
And I've made my decision
This is religion
There's no doubt
I'm one of the devout
Trying to sell the story
Of love's eternal glory

Sacred
Holy
To put it in words
To write it down
That is walking on hallowed ground
I'm a missionary

Spreading the news around the world
Taking the word to boys and girls
I'm a firm believer
And a warm receiver
And I will go down on my knees
When I'll see beauty
There's no doubt
I'm one of the devout
Trying to sell the story
Of love's eternal glory

Sacred
Holy
To say it in words
To write it down
That is walking on hallowed ground
I'm a missionary I am Iron Man

Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all,
Or if he moves will he fall?
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?

He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge

Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again! Ooh baby, baby you don't move no more
Ooh-wee baby, you don't move no more
I believe, baby I believe I'm gonna let you go

Lord, early in the mornin', baby
You don't wash my face like you used to do
Well, early in the mornin', baby
You don't wash my face like you used to do
Well, you know baby, baby you know that'll never do

Oh, if I should cry, baby would that do poor B. any good?
Well, if I should cry darlin', honey, would it do poor B. any good?
Well, I hate for all my people to know baby
I'm the biggest fool in the neighborhood Translucent plains envisioned beyond the horizon,
I hear the flapping of wings,
The bestoking tranquillity of irredescent spectrum,
The birds circle around my presence,
Hinting at pale sightings of Kadmos,
All alone for dust ridden aeons,
Alienation Your inner method of nirvana,
There is no night, no day -
Kadmos Your preserved brotherhood,
The ivory Your only solace,
In flight we persevere into the lights of the ivory plains,
Structures from silence,
Petals in the stream,
Murk above the dark moor,
The eastwinds brush the dust from Your prophetic throne,
In lands of I never saw,
Where the equinox was permanent,
The elephants trun the icon of Your only existence,
For their is nothing else,
In flight we persevere into the mists of ivory plains,
Foregather in the name of Moros and remember our lands. Bones sinking like stones all that we've fought for
Homes, places we've grown, all of us are done for

And we live in a beautiful world, yeah we do, yeah we do
We live in a beautiful world

Bones sinking like stones, all that we've fought for
Homes, places we've grown, all of us are done for

And we live in a beautiful world, yeah we do, yeah we do
We live in a beautiful world
And we live in a beautiful world, yeah we do, yeah we do
We live in a beautiful world

Oh all that I know, there's nothing here to run from
'Cause yeah, everybody here's got somebody to lean on I'm a wounded soldier on a downtown train to your place
You've launched a secret heart with your face
You don't always say what I want to hear but you move me
Across the rooftops and into the deep blue sea

Did we not choose each other
Are we just heroes for a day
This time I will stand by you
And mine is the heart I will save

I drew a hard line but I just can't see it
Your colours are bleeding all over my bullshit
I wanna be your star but I gotta learn to feel myself
I want your love and I need your help

Did we not choose each other
Are we just heroes for a day
This time I will stand by you
And mine is the heart I will save
Can we not judge each other
I'd rather wipe your tears away
I can follow my heart till the end
But I just can't choose the way

Just because we live like dolphins together
So many reasons to break the wave
We can swim from streetlamp to streetlamp
We can be kissing in the rain

Can we not judge each other
I'd rather wipe your tears away
I can follow my heart till the end
But I just can't choose the way

Listen baby, listen baby don't you do me wrong
I can make my bed, you can sing your song
Ain't nobody else gonna make you shine
If it's the truth you seek then darlin' love you'll find
I don't wanna, I don't wanna take your pain away
Isn't yours to give, isn't mine to save
Here's my heart, here's my hand, here's my soul
Take it in, take it apart, take it easy, let it go
(Repeat three times) Homeboys take time and elevate your mind
We came to rock the spot, rock the spot
Homegirls inside just let your nature rise
We came to rock the spot, rock the spot

Now Gabby got the verbal that'll get your little wifey out her girdle
In a session with me lightin' up a little herbal
Turtle shell
School individuals that listen to me
Word it well
Given to the rapper who is livin' to be heard and held
In a high esteem
I get you drunker than your bourbon, ale, liquor, malt, my assault learned it well
Turn the tables of time with my perception
Building staples of rhyme hear my reflections
"On a little" life I'm livin' in a universe with no beginning to it
So it ain't an ending and at times I get to diggin into infinite subliminably spirited
A nigga with a "clip and send it rip"
Indigenous stork has just touched ground
Rappers organizations get shut down
Not that I don't wanna see my brothers succeed
But rap it's like a sport, I dominate, so follow my lead
I be the G-I-F-T test me hefty left's be gettin' swung
Cruise like a jet ski
Up in yo apartment and plop on your couch y'all
Undisputed heavyweight lyrical southpaw

It's like a lime to a lemon-that rhymes, I assemble them
At times when I'm " " they shine you remember
" " Divine forces " " that refine men and women &amp;
I rhyme for a livin', not just for the scrilla man
That isn't what it's all about, really now, valid clout
Uzi MC's I have arguments 'n' fallin' outs wit'
About what it's all about, ain't about foamin out the mouth
Like a walkin' tall can of Guinness Stout
" "
When the battle cries soundin'
Ding-ding, hit 'em like, bing-bing
Eat 'em like, B-King, yet wit' no seasoning-bee sting
Wich yo girl dressed in a g-string she's swingin'
My way shorty and it sure looks good
I'm cookin up a batch of dopeness like a good cook should
I be the jack of trades, rappers pray
That I don't decapitate, after they cash his ass
Is that an irate? Great!
Grade-A, top-choice lyricism
Hey, hit me wit' that shell shocked rhythm
One time fo' the funky rhymes I say
Two times for the beat and for my DJ
It don't stop

I say we drop it on a (one), we drop it on a (two)
We comin' out (fresh), and we do it (for you)
You know the deal with Blackalicious, we don't play
(From New York, NY) (to streets of LA) to (??)
You know we leave the party wreakin' a disaster
For the new "millie", rain like a shower
Let it seep in your pores (??)
Oh lord that's [scratch]
Rock ya from the top and to the bottom (from the bottom to the top)
('Cause I grab the mic) wit the intent to get ill
A natural that you know who is (still Mrs. Field's)
So slide to the side and (take it light) and (throw your hands in the air) all night (party people in the place...)
I make 'em suffer, to the fallen MC's I'd be the (quicker pickem upper) (galactic of a nebula)
I'm rappin' the spectacular, attackin whack amateurs 'n' back stabbin salamanders
Creepin' while I'm peepin on 'em (party time)
Before I used to hit the meetings it was (Thunderbird wine) (used to drink the Ole)
Now I drink Calistoga, sober and I'm older
But the world is still gettin' colder (colder)
The Gift of Gab don't stop (the way I feel I have just got to rock) Hey, hey, hey, hey

You were so blind to let me go
You had it all but did not know
No one you'll find will ever be
Closer to all your dreams than me

Believing the grass would be greener
You told yourself, "I just don't need her now."
But I know you'll soon discover
You're never satisfied with any other

Someday, ooh someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey, hey
Boy you're gonna pay, 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

You'll change your mind and call my name
Soon as you find they're all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don't come back crying, you should have known

Believe me, I'm not pretending
It's not hard to predict this ending now
'Cause I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me in spite of all the others

Someday, ooh someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey, hey
Boy you're gonna pay, 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

(Someday, ooh someday)
(One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for)
(Someday, hey, hey)
(Boy you're gonna pay, 'cause) baby I'm the one who's keeping score

Maybe now you just can't conceive
That there'll ever come a time when you're cold and lonely
Baby, how could you ever believe
That another could replace me, the one and only

But when you're down in your time of need
And you're thinking that you
Might be coming back to own me
Just think again 'cause
I won't need your love anymore

Someday, ooh someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey, hey
Boy you're gonna pay, 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

Someday, ooh someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey, hey
Boy you're gonna pay, 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

Someday, ooh someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey, hey
Boy you're gonna pay, 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

Someday Speculate to break the one you hate
Circulate the lie you confiscate
Assassinate and mutilate
As the hounding media in hysteria
Who's the next for you to resurrect
JFK exposed the CIA
Truth be told the grassy knoll
As the blackmail story in all your glory

It's slander
You say it's not a sword
But with your pen you torture men
You'd crucify the Lord
And you don't have to read it, read it
And you don't have to eat it, eat it
To buy it is to feed it, feed it
So why do we keep foolin' ourselves

Just because you read it in a magazine

Don't make it factual, actual
They say he's homosexual

In the hood
Frame him if you could
Shoot to kill
To blame him if you will
If he dies sympathize
Such false witnesses
Damn self righteousness
In the black
Stab me in the back
In the face
To lie and shame the race
Heroine and Marilyn
As the headline stories of
All your glory

It's slander
With the words you use
You're a parasite in black and white
Do anything for news
And you don't go and buy it, buy it
And they won't glorify it, 'fy it
To read it sanctifies it, 'fies it
Then why do we keep foolin' ourselves

Just because you read it in a magazine

She's blonde and she's bisexual

Scandal

Do anything for news
And you don't go and buy it, buy it
And they won't glorify it, 'fy it
To read it sanctifies it, 'fies it

Slander
You say it's not a sin
But with your pen you torture men
Then why do we keep foolin' ourselves

You're so damn disrespectable I never wanted anything but this
I worked hard, tried hard
I ran around in domestic bliss
I fought hard, died hard

Everytime you're running
Out of here
Everytime you're running
I get the fear

I never wanted any broken bones
Scarred face, no home
Your words surround me and I asphyxiate
And I burn all hate

Everytime you're running
Out on me
Everytime you're running
I can see

I'm not a vegetable
I will not control myself
I spit on the hand that feeds me
I will not control myself

The waters break, the waters run
All over me
The waters break, the waters run
And this time you're gonna pay

I'm not a vegetable
I will not control myself
I spit on the hand that feeds me
I will not control myself It's a dead world...
And it's about that time to clear things here!
One generation follows another...
But something in my head says:
Keep going! don't give up!

Cold sweat - running down my back!
I don't fear the chaos!
A reason to fight is not making a stronger man
'Cause they don't understand!
I won't calm down! I won't calm down!
What am I supposed to do?
It's hard to realize that the time is running out!
Pow! we're on the move! resist worldwide!
Cause it takes two...
Your money is full of blood and I know this for sure -
We're gonna take over!
Radical! terrorize! and I'm not gonna tell you lies!
Our chances are low - too many problems we got!
Fuck the police! blow them out!

Destroy 2000 years of culture! destroy 2000 years of culture! (x4)
(Move! we gotta move! move! we gotta move!) (x 3)

Move! I shout it out loud!
We're radical and we're proud of it...


Change the things - together we stand and load the gun and make 'em swing'!
Love is a wonderful thing - a secret - a game
And I sing the song of freedom to hate!
Try to think international!

Destroy 2000 years of culture! destroy 2000 years of culture!
Destroy!
Destroy 2000 years of culture! destroy! destroy! (x3)
Destroy 200 years of culture! (x3)
(Move! we gotta move! move! we gotta move!) (x2)
Destroy 2000 years

Your freedom to speak is a freedom to lie
Whatever it takes to change ... I'm up for it!
There's no place where no one gets hurt...
A place where I can be on my own!
You should feel guilty if you're just watching!
There's this pain and a constant sound in my head...
They always try and get you back to what they define as reality!
There's nothing to lose but watch your back!
It's cold out here... (don't wait too long!)

Destroy 2000 years of culture! destroy! destroy! (x6)
(Move! we gotta move! move! we gotta move!) (x4)
Destroy 2000 years of culture! destroy 2000 years of culture! Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile,
And you use it only for me,
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile,
And you use it only for me.

So use it and prove it,
Remove this whirling sadness,
I'm losing, I'm bluesing,
But you can save me from madness.

Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile,
And you use it only for me,
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile,
And you use it only for me.

So save me I'm waiting,
I'm needing, hear me pleading,
And soothe me, improve me,
I'm grieving, I'm barely believing now, now.

When you are flying around and around the world,
And I'm lying and lonely,
I know there's something sacred and free reserved,
And received by me only.

Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile,
And you use it only for me,
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile,
And you use it only for me.

So use it and prove it,
Remove this whirling sadness,
I'm losing, I'm bluesing,
But you can save me from madness, now, now.

When you are flying around and around the world,
And I'm lying and lonely,
I know there's something sacred and free reserved,
And received by me only.

Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile,
And you use it only for me,
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile.

Nobody knows it, nobody knows it, nobody knows it,
But you've got a secret,
Nobody knows it, nobody knows it, nobody knows it,
But you've got a secret.

Nobody knows it, (use it) nobody knows it, nobody knows it,
But you've got a secret,
Nobody knows it, (I'm bluesing) nobody knows it, nobody knows it,
But you've got a secret.

Nobody knows it, (use it) nobody knows it... Through acrid clouds of summer flies
The garden swells with a thousand more wise
Forever flung to celestial dreams
Clawing at the grave of the dead Nazarene

I watch the storm approaching
The darkness calls my name
The trees are growing restless
They feel the season change
Their fruit has putrefied
Forbidden once and bound to die
The thread of life lies severed
On the brink of paradise

Grinning winds of hate unfurled
Towers tall that grip the sun
Talons stretch 'neath her veil
Reclamation, our time has come
Our time has come

Autumn spreads its golden wings
And lays the path for those unseen
A tangled web of evil spun at last
Winter spawn from barren thighs
To readdress, to slay the blind
And throw the reins untethered to the skies

They pray to the full moon rising
Diana moving with such infinite grace
Wrapped alone in a blanket of nightfall
How many secrets can they read by your face?

Will they know of majesty
Of beauty held in dream-dead sleep
And scarlet seas that bleed the frozen shores?
Will their God of bridled love
Assuage our rule from planes above
Or shrink in fear from chaos roused for war?

War!

Wrest askew the nails
That have held you, lurking deep
September prayers are waning
Burn the shrines of fettered sheep
Spearhead the insurrection
Of a world that seeks no end
We are what we are, what we shall be, again
Again

Appear; draped in terror
To the comfort of your kin
Stain the milky sunset red
And let the others

Summer's dying I cried all the way to the altar
A smile was on my face
But tears were in my heart

Two hearts broken
And a third will soon falter
Now too late, I know that we
Were wrong to part

Oh my darlin', now too late
We can't go back and start anew
Now too late, I've thrown away
My chance of happiness with you

I cried all the way to the altar
Now too late, I know that we
Were wrong to part

Take a calendar and turn back all the pages
Take my life, turn back each day since I was born
I cried all the way to the altar
Now too late, I see the damage I have done

Oh, my darling, now too late
We can't go back and start anew
Now too late, I've thrown away
My chance of happiness with you

I cried all the way to the altar
Now too late, I know that we
Were wrong to part And I...

Darlin' I, I can't explain
Where did we lose our way
Girl it's drivin' me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
If you come back to me
I'll guarantee
That I'll never let you go

Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again, until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

So many nights I dream of you
Holding my pillow tight
I know that I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes
To face reality
Every moment without you
It seems like eternity
I'm begging you, begging you come back to me


Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again, until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

Baby, I'm sorry.
Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done.
Please come back home girl.
I know you put all your trust
In me, I'm sorry I let you down.
Please forgive me girl.

I'm gonna swallow my pride
Say I'm sorry
Stop pointing fingers, the blame is on me
I want a new life
And I want it with you
If you feel the same
Don't ever let it go
You gotta believe, in the spirit of love
It can heal all things
We won't hurt any more
No I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees, begging you please
Come home


Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee

Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again, until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee Should have seen it coming when roses died
Should have seen the end of summer in your eyes
Should have listened when you said, "Goodnight"
You really meant goodbye
Baby, ain't it funny, how I never ever learn to fall?
You're really on your knees when you think you're standing tall
But only fools are 'Know it all's' and I played that fool for you

I cried and I cried there were nights that I died for you, baby
I tried and I tried to deny that your love drove me crazy, baby

If the love that I've got for you is gone
If the river I cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song

Baby, I thought you and me would stand the test of time
Like we got away with the perfect crime
But we were just a legend in my mind
I guess that I was blind
Remember those nights dancing at the masquerade?
The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
You and I were the renegades, some things never change

It made me so mad 'cause I wanted it bad for us, baby
And now it's so sad that whatever we had, ain't worth saving

If the love that I got for you is gone
And if the river I've cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song
If the pain that I'm feelin' so strong is the reason that I'm holding on
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song

I cried and I cried there were nights that I died for you, baby
I tried and I tried to deny that your love drove me crazy, baby

If the love that I got for you is gone
If the river I cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't no love song
If the pain that I'm feeling so strong is the reason I'm holdin' on
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song The stone that the builder refused
Will always be the head conerstone
The stone that the builder refused
Will always be the head cornerstone

You're a builder, oh, la di la
Here I am a stone
Don't you think and refuse me
Cause the things people refuse
Are the things they should refuse
Do you hear me, hear what I say

The stone that the builder refused
Will always be the head conerstone
The stone that the builder refused
Will always be the head cornerstone

I can be soft as a pillow
Weep like a willow
Caress and bring happiness
Don't refuse me, don't you refuse
Don't don't don't you refuse Ain't no love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love

We're missing in action living in a time when it's in fashion
To be gun flashing, blasting that's why we ain't lasting
All fastened, strapped ready for rivals harassing
Looking over your shoulder ducking cars that are passing
In my rumbo you hear that latin lingo
Guns shoot through at pachucos fuckin' sickos
With four nickels nobody walks around single
Get caught slipping they'll pull your card from a window
It's that simple locals get gaffled by barrio locos
Steal their Spanish grease making them shed a tear like willie bobo
Over dollars, chains and rings things that are worth poco
A coco's out there stealing 'cause they're fiending for perico
A head crack will strike and attack for a sack
Pawn or sell your shit to buy a rock and bring that high back
That's why I strap it's my defense against those
Who are committing defense randomly becoming foes?
Shit is survival of fittest testing who's biggest and realest on the street
Feel this beware of killers, stealers and dealers
Rebel guerillas striking on policemen who give us
Hard times in the city where no love is with us

Ain't no love
Ain't no love
In the city?
In the city?

Ain't no love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love
In the city
In the city
In the city
In the city

Ain't no love Album: ¿Dónde están los ladrones?
Shakira
Tú

Te regalo mi cintura,
Y mis labios para cuando quieras besar,
Te regalo mi locura
Y las pocas neuronas que quedan ya.
Mis zapatos desteñidos,
El diario en el que escribo,
Te doy hasta mis suspiros,
Pero no te vayas más,
Porque eres tú mi sol,
La fe con que vivo,
La potencia de mi voz,
Los pies con que camino,
Eres tú, amor,
Mis ganas de reírme,
El adiós que no sabré decir 
Porque nunca podré vivir sin ti.
Si algún día decidieras,
Alejarte nuevamente de aquí,
Cerraría cada puerta,
Para que nunca pudieras salir.
Te regalo mis silencios,
Te regalo mi nariz,
Yo te doy hasta mis huesos,
Pero quédate aquí,
Porque eres tú mi sol,
La fe con que vivo,
La potencia de mi voz,
Los pies con que camino,
Eres tú, amor,
Mis ganas de reírme,
El adiós que no sabré decir 
Porque nunca podré vivir sin ti.

Translation
I give you my waist
and my lips, for when you want to kiss,
I give you my madness
and the few neurons they left me

My discolored shoes, the diary in which I write, I give even my sighs, 
but don't leave anymore

Because you are, my sun, the faith with I live
the strength of my voice
the feet I use to walk.
It is you my love, my desires to live
the goodbye I don't know how to say 
because I will be never able to live without you

If one of these day you would decide to get away from me
I would close every door, so you could never go out
I give you my silence, I give you my nose,
I give you even my bones, but stay here.

Because you are, my sun, the faith with I live
the strength of my voice
the feet I use to walk.
It is you my love, my desires to laugh
the goodbye I don't know how to say 
because I will be never able to live...
....without you First thing we'd climb a tree 
And maybe then we'd talk
Or sit silently 
And listen to our thoughts
With illusions of someday 
Casting a golden light
No dress rehearsal
This is our life

And that's where the hornet stung me
And I had a feverish dream
With revenge and doubt
Tonight we smoke them out

You are ahead by a century (this is our life)
You are ahead by a century (this is our life)
You are ahead by a century

Stare in the morning shroud 
And then the day began
I tilted your cloud
You tilted my hand
Rain falls in real time 
And rain fell through the night
No dress rehearsal
This is our life

But that's when the hornet stung me
And I had a serious dream
With revenge and doubt
Tonight we smoke them out

You are ahead by a century (this is our life)
You are ahead by a century (this is our life)
You are ahead by a century

You are ahead by a century (this is our life)
You are ahead by a century (this is our life)
You are ahead by a century

And disappointing you is getting me down Now everybody wants to know the truth about a brother named Quik
I come from the school of the sly, wicked and the slick
A lotta people already know excatly where it's at
'Cause it's the home of the jackers and the crack
(Compton) Yeah, that's the name of the hometown
I'm goin' down in the town where my name is all around
The suckers just be havin' a fit, and that's a pity
But I ain't doin' nothin' but (claimin my city)
See, my lyrics I'm doublin up and provin to suckers that I can throw
I'm passin a natural ten or four or six or eight before I go
Yes, I'm definitely freestylin, all the while still profilin
Never a trickster, DJ Quikster steals the show
So now that's how I'm livin'
I do as I please, you see
A younger brother that's up on reality
Cause everybody knows you have to be stompin
If you're born and raised in Compton

(Born and raised)
(Born and raised)
(Born and raised in Compton)

(Where you from, fool?)
(Compton)

Now Compton is the place where the homeboys chill, you see
But then I found that it wasn't no place for me
Cause way back in the day somebody musta wanted me to quit
Because they broke in my house and cold stole my shit
They musta thought that I was gonna play the punk role
Just because my equipment got stole
But I ain't goin' out like no sucker-ass clown
They found they couldn't keep a dope nigga down
So here's some bass in your face, muthafucka silly sucker-
Ass clocker, now you're duckin, cause you can't stop a brother
Like the Quiksta, because I'm true to the game
You're lame, and things ain't gonn' never be the same
Cause a nigga like the Quik is takin' over
I really don't think I should have to explain
It, oh yeah, I'm a dog, but my name ain't Rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feelin' no pain
Sometimes I have to wear a bullet-proof vest
Because I got the 'Cpt' sign written across my chest
A funky dope brother never ceases to impress
My name is DJ Quik, so you can fuck the rest
I'm comin' like this, and I'm comin' directly
Cause suckers get dain-bramaged if I'm doin' damage quite effectively
Rhymin is a battlezone, and suckers have no win
'Cause I'm a veteran from the C-o-m-p-t-o-n
Kick it

(Born and raised)

Hell muthafuckin yeah
Funky dope for the nine-ace
DJ Quik is in the muthafuckin house
Yeah

(Born and raised in Compton)

Yo, check this shit out
Right about now
I'd like to send a shout out to my buddy Teddy Bear
What's up nigga?
What's up KK?

And last but not least I'd like to thank Shabby Blue
And we out
Peace Mother Tongue speaks to Me
In the strongest way I've ever seen
I know that she sees in Me
Her proudest child, her purest breed

She speaks to Me in colours
That I can't really understand
I only know that they are ours
And to those I'll proudly bend

For I am your only child
And you my dearest mystery
From an ancient throne I defy the world
To kneel before the Power within.

For I am your only child
And you my dearest mystery
World can't you see it?
Am I alone in my belief?

Virando costas ao Mundo
Orgulhosamente sós
Glória Antiga, volta a nós!

ALMA MATER!

Breaking waves announce my Bride
It is the only way the Sea could sing
Legends of Lusitanian pride
He sings the words I cannot spring

At the Moon Mountain six wolves cry
Your lost glory we'll regain or die

For I am her only child
And she is my dearest mystery
Pagan Gods in conspiracy
For the sword of Tyranny

Mother Tongue has spoke to thee
In the strongest way they've ever seen
World can't you see ?
I am not alone in my belief.

Virando costas ao Mundo
Orgulhosamente sós
Glória Antiga, volta a nós!

ALMA MATER!

Virando costas ao Mundo

ALMA MATER The breath of the morning, I keep forgetting
The smell of the warm summer air
I live in a town where you can't smell a thing
You watch your feet for cracks in the pavement

High up above aliens hover
Making home movies for the folks back home
Of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets

They're all uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight

I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when I'm driving
Take me on board their beautiful ship
Show me the world as I'd love to see it

I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely
I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
They'd shut me away
But I'd be all right
All right
I'm all right
All right

I'm just uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight

Uptight <span style="padding:1em"><img alt="TrebleClef" class="lzy lzyPlcHld" data-image-key="TrebleClef.png" data-image-name="TrebleClef.png" data-src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/lyricwiki/images/1/1e/TrebleClef.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/30?cb=20090423154754" height="68" onload="if(typeof ImgLzy==='object'){ImgLzy.load(this)}" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" width="30"/><noscript><img alt="TrebleClef" class="" data-image-key="TrebleClef.png" data-image-name="TrebleClef.png" height="68" src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/lyricwiki/images/1/1e/TrebleClef.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/30?cb=20090423154754" width="30"/></noscript></span> Instrumental This is where your sanity gives in
And love begins
Never lose your grip
Don't trip
Don't fall
You'll lose it all
The sweetest way to die
It lies deep inside
You can not hide
It's the meanest fire
Oh, it's a strange desire
You can not lie
That's a needless fight
This is where your sanity gives in
And love begins
Never lose your grip
Don't trip
Don't fall
You'll lose it all
The sweetest way to die
When your blood runs dry
You're paralyzed
It will eat your mind
Did you hold it back
It comes to you in slow attacks
It's the meanest fire Hit it

(C'mon, c'mon) Unfortunately, we are not licensed to display the full lyrics for this song at the moment. Hopefully we will be able to in the future. Until then... how about a random page? I dream about, how it's gonna end
Approaching me quickly
Living a life of fear
I only want my mind to be clear

People, making fun of me
For no reason but jealousy
I fantasize about my death
I'll kill myself, from holding my breath

My suicidal dream
Voices telling me what to do
My, suicidal dream
I'm sure you will get yours too

Help me, comfort me
Stop me from feeling what I'm feeling now
The rope is here, now I'll find a use
I'll kill myself, I'll put my head in a noose

My suicidal dream
Voices telling me what to do
My, suicidal dream
I'm sure you will get yours too

Dreamin' about my death, dream
Suicidal, suicidal, suicidal dream
I'm suicidal, suicidal dream If I ever leave you... you can say I told you so!
And if I ever hurt you baby... you know I hurt myself as well.

Is that any way for a man to carry on
Do you think I want his little loved one gone
I love you baby
More than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever know

When I wasn't making to much money
You know where my paycheck went
You know I brought it home to baby
And I never spent one red cent

Is that any way for a man to carry on
Do you think he wants his little loved one gone
I love you baby
More than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever know

I'm not trying to be
Any kind of man
I'm trying to be somebody
You can love, trust and understand
I know that I can be
Yeah
A part of you that no one else could see

I just wanna hear, a hear ya say
It's all right
Yeah yeah

Only flesh and blood
But I can be everything that you demand
I can be president of general motors baby
Or just a tiny little grain of sand

Is that anyway for a man to carry on
Do you think he wants his little loved one gone
I love you baby, I love you baby
I love youMore than you'll ever know

If I ever leave you... you can say I told you so!
And if I ever hurt you ... you know I hurt myself as well.

Is that anyway for a man to carry on
Do you think he wants his little loved one gone
I treid to tell ya I love you baby, I love you baby
Yeah I love you baby
I love you More than you'll ever know

I love you
I love you
I love you baby!

I told you so many times before
I love you
I love Somebody loan me a dime
I need to call my old time, used to be
Somebody loan me a dime
Mmm, I need to call my old time, used to be

Ooh, little girl's been gone so long
You know it's worrying me
Hey, it's worrying, worrying me

I know she's a good girl
But at that time I just didn't understand
I know she's a good girl
But at that time I just didn't understand
Oh, you know I didn't

Somebody loan me a dime
You know I need, I need a helping hand
Somebody

Yeah, she's a good girl
But at that time I just didn't understand
Ooh, I know she's a good girl
But at that time I just could not understand
Whoa, no

Somebody better loan me that dime
To ease my worried mind
Whoa

Now, I cried, just cried
Just like a baby all night long
Ooh, you know I cried, just cried
Just like a baby, all night long

Whoa, somebody better loan me that dime
I need my baby, I need my baby here at home
Ooh, yeah <span style="padding:1em"><img alt="TrebleClef" class="lzy lzyPlcHld" data-image-key="TrebleClef.png" data-image-name="TrebleClef.png" data-src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/lyricwiki/images/1/1e/TrebleClef.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/30?cb=20090423154754" height="68" onload="if(typeof ImgLzy==='object'){ImgLzy.load(this)}" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" width="30"/><noscript><img alt="TrebleClef" class="" data-image-key="TrebleClef.png" data-image-name="TrebleClef.png" height="68" src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/lyricwiki/images/1/1e/TrebleClef.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/30?cb=20090423154754" width="30"/></noscript></span> Instrumental Cool breeze and autumn leaves
Slow motion daylight
A lone pair of watchful eyes
Oversee the living
Feel the presence all around
A tortured soul
A wound unhealing
No regrets or promises
The past is gone
But you can still be free...
If time will set you free...

Time now to spread your wings
To take to flight
The life endeavor
Aim for the burning sun
You're trapped inside
But you can still be free...
If time will set you free...
But it's a long long way to go

Keep moving way up high
You see the light
It shines forever
Sail through the crimson skies
The purest light
The light that sets you free...
If time will set you free...

Sail through the wind and rain tonight
You're free to fly tonight
And you can still be free...
If time will set you free...
And go high like the mountain tops
And go high like the wind don't stop
And go high
Hoo
Free to fly tonight
Free to fly tonight Care not for the men who wonder
Straw that broke your back, you're under
Cast all them aside who care
Empty eyes and dead end stare

Don't you know that none are blind
To the lie, and you think I don't find what you hide?

What in God's name have you done?
Stick your arm for some real fun

For the horse you've grown much fonder
Than for me, that I don't ponder
As the hair of one who bit you
Smiling bite your own self, too

And I think that you're not blind
To the ones you left behind
I'll be here

What in God's name have you done?
Stick your arm for some real fun

So be yearning all your life
Twisting, turning like a knife

Now you know the reasons why
Can't get high, or you will die
Or you'll die

What in God's name have you done?
Stick your arm for some real fun
So your sickness weighs a ton
And God's name is smack for some The California animal is a bear
Angeleno but the devil may care
Summer - time to talk to and swear
Later maybe we could share some air
I'll take to you the movies there
We could walk through Leicester Square
What could be wetter than
An English girl, American man

London in the summertime
Call me now, use the satellite
London in the summertime
Cuss me out and it'll be all right

Hesitate but don't refuse
The choice is yours but you said choose
The look she used was green and sharp
Stabbed that boy all in his heart
Come what may, the cosmos will
Take me up and down on Primirose Hill
What could be wetter than
An English girl, American man

London in the summertime
Call me now, use the satellite
London in the summertime
Cuss me out and it'll feel all right

Cuss me out and it'll feel all right
It's all right now
Call me now, use the satellite
It's all right
It's all right

Down and out and it'll sound all right
It's all right now
It's all right

The California flower is a poppy child
Felony sends me all the gold in your smile
Drift away from anyone you can
Nothing ever goes according to plan
Though I know that every river bends
Time to say hello to snow on the Thames
What could be wetter than
An English girl, American man

London in the summertime
Call me now, use the satellite
London in the summertime
Cuss me out and it'll feel all right (Prodigy)
Yo, the saga begins, beget war
I draw first blood be the first to set it off
My cause, tap all jaws lay down laws
We takin' what's yours we do jerks rush the doors
Here come the deez tryin' to make breeze and guns toss
In full force, my team'll go at your main source
We're not tourists, hit bosses and take hostage
Your whole setup, from the ground up we lock shit
Blood flood your eye, fuck up your optics
Switch to killer instincts for niggaz pop shit
Yo nigga Noyd what's the topic? Nine pound we rocked in
Ninety-six strike back with more hot shit
Illuminate my team'll glow like, radiation
With no time for patient, or complication
Let's get it done right, my click airtight
Trapped in a never ending gunfight so niggaz lose stripes
Or lose life, jail niggaz sendin kites to the street
Over some beef that wasn't fully cooked, finish 'em off
Well done meat, that said twenty-two slug to your head
Travel all the way down to your leg

Chorus: together

Aiyyo it's hell on earth, whose next or gonna be first
The projects is front lines, and the enemy is one time
I ain't gotta tell you
It's right in front of your eyes
(Repeat 2X)

(Havoc)
We wreck the QBC, nigga rep yours it's all love
Milli stacked down, heavenly guarded by hollow tip slug
Then crack down, on wannabe thugs adapt to gat sound
And bow down, slow the fuck up, see how my foul now
Articulate, hittin body parts to start shiftin shit
Never hesitant, it's the crack game unlimited
Summon rasta we can do this, forever infinite
Then reminesce, twenty years later how we was gettin' it
Either with me go against the grain you better hit me
Leggin me or robbin me niggaz better body me
'Cause it's a small world and niggaz, talkin' like bitches
Bitches singin' like snitches, pointin you out in pictures
'Cause she rep the QBC faithfully, playa hatin' me
All that bullshit, is just makin' me
More the better, then concentrate on gettin' chedda
If shorty set you up you better dead her, I told you
Shape and mold you, Sun you, then I hold you
Like a pimp mind control you double edge blow you
It'll be I, like I'm supposed to, the click is coastal
International to local, Bacardi mix physically fix
Hit you with shit, that'll leave a loose nigga stiff
Probably thick, Son I solved em
Pulled him in my world then evolved him to chaos
Walk the beat like, around the way cops the average pitstop
QBCity GodFather Part III, Gotti Gambino
And Ty Nitty, Scarface rest in peace

(Prodigy)
Yo, the heavy metal king hold big shit, with spare clips
You seein clips when the mac spit your top got split
Layin dead with open eyes close his eyelids
Turn off his lights switch to darkness, cause deep in the abyss
Is street life, blood on my kicks, shit on my knife
Youse the wild child, kid cold turnin' men into mice
I was born to take power leave my mark on this planet
The Phantom of Crime Rap, niggaz is left stranded
Shut down your operation, closed for business
Leave a foul taste in your mouth, like Guinness
POW niggaz is found MIA
We move like the special forces, green beret
Heavily around my throat, I don't play
Shit brand new, back in eighty-nine, the same way
The God P walk with a limp see, but simply
To simplify shit, no man can go against me
Test me you must be bent G, don't tempt me
I had this full clip for so long, it needs to empty
The reason why it full for so long, 'cause I don't waste shit
You probably hid, blood in your mouth, so you could taste it
Quiet as kept, I lay back and watch the world spin
I hear thugs, claimin that they gonna rob the Mobb
When they see us, I tell you what black, here's the issue
It's a package deal, you rob me, you take this message
Along with that, I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm tryin' to make CREAM and that's that
Whatever it takes however it gots to go down
Four mikes on stage a motherfuckin four pound
Speakers leakin out sound and niggaz leakin on the ground
I could truly care less the God will get his
Regardless blow for blow let's find out who wear hardest
This rap artist used to be a stickup artist
Sometimes I test myself see if I still got it
A live nigga stay on point never diss
Regard shit or forget the essence, from which I emerged
P is sick, so save that bullshit for the burbs
Live up to my word, if I got beef, niggaz comin' in herds
We flush through your click get purged We skipped the light Fandango
Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kind of seasick
But the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

And so it was that later
As the Miller told his tale
That a face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

She said there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might just as well've been closed

And so it was later
As the Miller told his tale
AThat a face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

And so it was later
As the Miller told his tale
That a face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale
A whiter shade of pale
Turneda whiter shade of pale
A whiter shade of pale (Havoc talking)

Let's do it dunn... My man... That's why I keep my mouth tight.
Ain't got no worries for y'all niggaz man... y'all niggaz is crazy

(Prodigy)
Hey yo, its hell on earth down here the pavement scorching
Its more on roc when the Mobb walks in
Shit gets hot like a ill pot of grits spilled on you
Spit fire with nines but never squealed on you

I understood you should try to take my life
If I was you I would too damn right
If I had drama with a nigga like such as myself
I couldn't even sleep at night until...
I made things right
Pull out guns exchange a fight
Be the first to let off mines ignite the pipes...
And never let the daylight deceive
During the suns' hours niggaz do bleed
Aim for the waist and something on the top gets shot
Niggaz can't shoot never made a thing drop
Keep cream of the crop
Fresh out of box shit filled to the top
Smell the barrell when its bolt-locked nigga

Hook1 (PRODIGY)
Have you ever lost a loved one?
Or never understood love till you lost one?
Where your heart at?
I left mines behind with my dearly departed
Where your heart at? Strength missing
To take losses is the hardest
The ones that overcome be the calmest
Strive regardless. Where your heart at? Brave-hearted.
Now lets find out where niggaz hearts' at

(Havoc)
This is to my physical you gone... to me you still here
I be buggin thinking how you doin' up there
Probably watching over me calling out my fouls
Fuck with mad chicks but I take care of my child
I miss that ass tell God I said pardon me
If Your real; He'll forgive me (no doubt)
But I ain't crying no more about how you're gone
Used to hold me down niggaz front its on
Ain't wetting going to jail you better shoot me
Just lost my heart-If I die you comin' wit' me
Quickly while I'm pissy they're just bitches that's a little to frisky
Risky on point hope these cats is getting the point whisper out my name
Stand but please don't point call me paranoid
But I'm on point close by the stash joint Got you in my mind
I guess that's why the say love is blind

Hook 2 (PRODIGY)
Strength missing we take losses. be the hardest
The ones that overcome be the calmest. Strive regardless
Where your heart at? Brave-hearted.
You better finish what you started (dunn)
If you ever lost a loved one?
You'll never understand love till you lost one.
Where your heart at?
I left mines behind with my dearly departed
Where your heart at? Strength missing
To take losses be the hardest
The ones that overcome be the calmest
Strive regardless. Where your heart at? Brave-hearted.
Now lets find out where niggaz hearts' at

Have you ever lost a loved one?
You'll never understand love till you lost one.
Where your heart at?
I left mines' behind wit' my dearly departed
Now where your heart at?

(Prodigy)
I find myself dozing off with it (guns)
Waking up every forty minutes (dun)
Soaking wet dripped to death in it
On top of rules big barells and tools get tested
And hittin off makes my dick get erected
We all strive for a better tomorrow
But as far as today your ass gotsa' pay
And ain't no time better than the present one at hand
And never keep your shit too far from your hand

(Havoc)
Think about this are you with your hands on who you running with
Some timers, Playa' hata's and dick riders
Bent niggaz' that be crashin into dividers
Gettin' you into shit got that ass tied up
Got them la'd up got you comin' out of your vault
With no plans of giving back live in serious debt.
Your lady fucking other niggaz you a fool for her
Talking 'bout you got money you just using her
Actually losin' her... Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little east coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft

It's long overdue but now Philly's slammin'
Boyz II Men, ABC, BBD, the east coast family
Never skipped a beat, na, while cooling on South street
Jet black Benz, plenty of friends and all the Philly steaks you can eat

Back in school we used to dream about this everyday
Could it really happen or do dreams fade away?
Then we started singing them, they said it sounded smooth
So we started a group and here we are, kickin' it just for you

Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little east coast swing
Boyz II Men going off

The spotlight is on us now, watch us do this
Da da, daaa da da, da da da da da da
Live and direct from Philly town, rap and hype and we can get down
We are ready to roll, so now the world will know that we roll

Back in school we used to dream about this everyday
Could it really happen or do dreams fade away?
Then we started singing them, they said it sounded smooth
So we started a group and here we are, kickin' it just for you

Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little east coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft

Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men

Then we started singing them
They said it sounded smooth (Yo, yo!)

Mmm, now check this out, one day back in Philly
Four guys wanted to sing
They came up to me, I said: "What's your name?" (Boyz II Men)
Hey, ya know what I'm sayin'?

Then I said: "Alright, fellas, well let me see what you can do"
And then the smiling one named Wanya said: "Yo, Mike, check this out
See if this one move you"

Doom doom doom da da, doom doom doom da da

Wild goose chase
Wild goose chase
You're gonna take me boy on a wild goose chase
You're gonna take me boy on a wild goose chase
You better find somebody to take my place

You took my imagination and stomped it inthe ground
Now I can only think about you
Chasin' the tracks that you left around

Hole in my head
Hole in my head
Oh I need a boy like you like a hole in my head
I need a boy like you like a hole in my head
You make me feel so bad that I wish I was dead

People must think I'm lazy

Listen to the shit because we kick it until dawn
Listen to the abstract got it going on
Listen to the ladies come on and let me spawn
All your eggs then you go up the river
Listen to the abstract, that freaky nigga

Now, I'm Ad Rock and I shock and I tick and I tock
And I can't stop with the body rock
See I've got heart like John Starks
Hitting mad sparks
Pass me the mic and I'll be rocking the whole park

Well, I'm the M to the C to the A and it's a must
The rhymes that we bust on the topic of lust

(Uh) and my Moms is not butt, but fuck it
Let me get down to the rhythm
Yes I'm getting funky and I'm shooting all my jism
Like John Holmes, the X-rated nigga
Listen to the shit 'cause I am the ill figure
Nobody's getting any bigger than this

(Get it together)
(Get it, get it together)
Phone is ringing Oh my God
(Get, get it together)
(See what's happening)

Ad Rock's down with the Ione
Listen to the shit because both of them is bony
Got to do it like this like Chachi And Joanie
'Cause she's the cheese and I'm the macaroni

So why all the fight and why all the fuss
'Cause hey (I ain't got no dust)
Yeah, you know I'm getting silly
Got a grandma Hazel and a grandma Tilly

Well, I'm the Grand Royal prez and I'm also a member
Born on the cusp in the month of November
I do the Patty Duke and in case you don't remember
Well, I freak a funky beat like the shit was in a blender

Well, I'm long gone, word is bond
Don't need a motherfucking fool telling me right from wrong
I don't think I'm slick nor do I play like I'm hard
But I'mma drive the lane like I was Evan Bernard

And I'm working on my game because life is taxing
Got to get it together and see what's happening

(Get it together)
Wait a minute, wait-wait a minute
(Get it together)
Wait a minute, wait-wait a minute
(Get it together)
Wait a minute, wait-wait a minute
(See what's happening)

I go one two like my name was Biz Mark
But I had to do the shit just let me embark
On the lyric and the noun and the verb
Let me kick the shit off 'cause yo, I'm not the herb

Well, it's not the herb but the spice with the flavor to spare
The Moog with the funk for your derriere
While we're on that topic, yes I like to mention
When it comes to boning--whoo--I'm representing

Spacing, zoning, talking on the phone and
My brain is roaming and I don't know where it's going
Talking lots of shit, a little tweaking on the weekend
Got to get him by the reigns because I know that I'm freaking

Well, I'm a funky skull and I'm a Scorpio
And when I get my flow I'm doctor on the go
So Q-Tip, what you on the mic for?

Because I had to talk about the times that I rhyme
And when MCs come in my face, I'm like mace
'Cause I back them off with the quills
'Cause I tell you, nigga 'cause I'll keep you under frills
Resting on nine one one Sixteenth Ave off the Farmers Boulevard, Boulevard, Boulevard, Boulevard

Yeah, I'm from Manhattan, M.C.A.'s from Brooklyn
Yeah, M.C.A., your shit be cooking

Praying mantis on the court and I can't be beat
So, yo Tip, what's up with the boots on your feet?
Got the Timbals on my toes and this is how it goes
Oh, one two oh my God

One two, oh my God, I've got some shit
I've got the kung fu grip behind my green trap kit
Never ever ever smoking crack, crack
Never ever ever fucking wack

I eat the fuckin' pineapple Now and Laters
Listen to me now, don't listen to me later
Fuck it 'cause I know I didn't make it fuckin' rhyme for real
But, yo technically, I'm as hard as steel

Gonna get it together, watch it
Gonna get it together Ma Bell
Like Ma Bell, I've got the ill communications
Ma Bell, got the ill communications (Who's that?)
Ma Bell (Word 'em up word word 'em up)
Ma Bell...

Keep it on and on, on and on, on and on, on and on The air is getting hotter
There's a rumbling in the skies
I've been wading through the high muddy water
With the heat rising in my eyes

Every day your memory grows dimmer
It doesn't haunt me like it did before
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

When I was in Missouri
They would not let me be
I had to leave there in a hurry
I only saw what they let me see

You broke a heart that loved you
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
I've been walking that lonesome valley
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

People on the platforms
Waiting for the trains
I can hear their hearts a-beatin'
Like pendulums swinging on chains

When you think that you've lost everything
You find out you can always lose a little more
I'm just going down the road feeling bad
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

I'm going down the river
Down to New Orleans
They tell me everything is gonna be all right
But I don't know what "all right" even means

I was riding in a buggy with Miss Mary Jane
Miss Mary Jane got a house in Baltimore
I been all around the world, boys
Now I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

Gotta sleep down in the parlor
And relive my dreams
I'll close my eyes and I wonder
If everything is as hollow as it seems

Some trains don't pull no gamblers
No midnight ramblers, like they did before
I been to Sugartown, I shook the sugar down
Now I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door I've seen a lot of sad people,
Seen a lot of strange things,
I've seen a lot of bad people,
Do a lot of bad things

You know I've done some traveling
I've done a little bit of this and that
You know I've done some wondering
But I always come back
Ya back

(Chrous)
And I rely upon your soul, I decided upon you
And I wonder do you think about me?
What do you think about me?
Do you think about me?
What do you think about me?

Where, You've seen me go from there to here
And where do I go from here, my head

You know I took a little time to figure it out
I took some time just to know what it's all about.
Won't surprise me what you say, no suprises,
Any old day.

And I rely upon your soul, I decided upon you
And I wonder do you think about me?

(Chrous)
And I rely upon your soul, I decided upon you
And I wonder do you think about me?
What do you think about me?
Say do you think about me?
What do you think about me?
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhow) I lift ya off the earth, mundane and glum
Out the solar system, way past the sun
Till all the fear in your heart is gone
And so on

Walkin' through the world with no pressure
Inner peace beyond measure
I was leaving, wearing what I came in
When a man said, "Stop"
"I wanna have what you have and get what you got"

I got it sleepin' rough on the streets in the rain
I got it learnin' to share my people's pain
I got it makin' flowers grow in hearts of stone
I got it 'cause I always take the long way home

I been walking through the world with no pressure
Air's fresher, full of vigour
Life becomes my mirror
The further I go, the more I know
Oh, yeah, wherever the wind blow
I'll be there
Turned up in places that I never intended to go
And so ended my youth

I once depended on proof
Now I'm in the flow
There are things I know beyond knowing
I've never seen a seed growin'
I was going back home
When a man said, "Stop"
"I wanna have what you have and get what you got"
