Now I just wanna get back to me
Oh baby, hoo hoo
Back into the man I used to be

Things that I said I wouldn't do, I did 'em
Secrets below the service of truth I hid 'em
This man kind is past, but can he erase
The tears of a million years is human race
Of animals, that talk and walk upright
Then slave all day and fall in a trance at night
Flowing the planet, trying to find missing links
Like the men we used to be and always suppose to think
Mysteries, maybe not
It's getting hot, we better configure the plot, but
I hold a pen with the grip so tight
That'a squeeze the ink out'ta the page, and write a song for the people
Came up from the underground, now I write above on a hovercraft sound
This microphone, like an an amphetamine
Keeping me clean, speaking in dreams
So nature can intervene, just for a scene

I tried it, I couldn't find it
Now I just wanna get back to me
Oh baby, hoo hoo
Back into the man I used to be

I walk along this path alone, my feet hurt
Lost some friends along the way, I did dirt
I went to church, I tried everything
From leaving my body, to watching the birds sing
For hours, so I could feel heavenly powers
Had been across the universe and inside of flowers
But what is it worth, I'm still just a man on the earth
Rappers are acting like man tan
Can I be candid, I can't stand it
Rap bandit, got heaven acting frantic
I wanna swing my sword decapitate
But what is a man if he acts like an ape
So I sit back, planning my great escape
Load up my EPS and peruse my record crate
The man I used to be, I can only see by looking beyond me
So what is reality, I don't know

I tried it, I couldn't find it
Now I just wanna get back to me
Oh baby, hoo hoo
Back into the man I used to be

Wrong song
You know what
I woke up in the morning
I took a trip to the corner store
That's when I heard my calling
But I'd never heard the voice of truth before
So I kept on walking
Pretended I didn't see
Walked by a window and my reflection said to me
You could try all the same
But you'll never know this mystery
There's no pilot on your plane
So you're not the man you used to be
Try all the game, but you'll never know this mystery
When your pilot has no plane
Said you're the man you used to be seen

Ya holler and ya holla, you folla you fall

'Cause I don't feel that I deserve the sunshine's rays.
The darkness helped until the whiskey wore away,
And it was then I realized that conscience never fades.
When you're young you have this image of your life:
That you'll be scrupulous and one day even make a wife.
And you make boundaries you'd never dream to cross,
And if you happen to you wake completely lost.
But I will fight for you, be sure that
I will fight until we're the special two once again.

And we will only need each other, we'll bleed together,
Our hands will not be taught to hold another's,
'Cause we're the special two.
And we could only see each other, we'll breathe together,
These arms will not be taught to need another's,
'Cause we're the special two.

I remember someone old once said to me:
That lies will lock you up with truth the only key
But I was comfortable and warm inside my shell,
And couldn't see this place could soon become my hell.
So is it better to tell and hurt or lie to save their face?
Well I guess the answer is don't do it in the first place.
I know I'm not deserving of your trust from you right now,
But if by chance you change your mind you know I will not
Let you down 'cause we were the special two, and will be again.

And we will only need each other, we'll bleed together,
Our hands would not be taught to hold another's,
'Cause we're the special two.
And we could only see each other we'll breathe together,
These arms will not be taught to need another's
'Cause we're the special two.

I step outside my mind's eyes for a minute.
And I look over me like a doctor looking for disease,
Or something that could ease the pain.
But nothing cures the hurt you bring on by yourself,
Just remembering, just remembering how we were

And we would only need each other, we'd bleed together,
These hands would not be taught to hold another's,
We were the special two.

To trust in every word.

Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail

Thirteen I was putting shells in a gauge on a shelf

I used to get punked and bullied on my block
Till I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox

What do I think of success?  It sucks, too much press I'm stressed

Too much cess and breasts, too upset
It's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick (yes)
Grew up quick (no) was raised right

Cause (I'mmmm) Shady, they call me as crazy
as the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way, *NSYNC, why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?

Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think?
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
Cause all these fans screaming is making my ears ring (AHHHH!!!)

So I just, throw up a middle finger and let it linger
longer than the rumor that I was sticking it to Christina
'Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez and Puffy you know this!

I'm sorry Puff, but I don't give a fuck if this chick was my own mother
I still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her
And have a son and a new brother at the same time

Maybe we're diving in over our heads
Scared of what I'm feeling
Staring at the ceiling here tonight

Come on lay down these arms, all our best defenses
We're taking our chances here on the run
The fear is an anchor, time is a stranger
Love isn't borrowed, we aren't promised tomorrow

We'll never be ready if we keep waiting
For the perfect time to come
Won't be steady, we'll never be ready

Where we don't know, though we can't see
Just walk on down this road with me
Won't be steady, never be ready

You're okay, you're with me here in the silence
With all of the violence crashing around
Saying we can't go, saying we don't know
This road that is narrow is the one we should follow

We'll never be ready if we keep waiting
For the perfect time to come
Won't be steady, we'll never be ready

Where we don't know, though we can't see
Just walk on down this road with me
Won't be steady, we'll never be ready

Steady my heart, it's beating faster
Steady my hands, this one can turn around
Steady my heart, it's beating faster, beating faster now

Funk from the fungus grown in the trench

Eliminate the fat gold chains and the diaper pants
Trade 'em for a pair Girbauds
Never make friends with the fraudulent foes

Skinny from the many that try to eat plenty
Now I got to flip on a copper like a penny

With a swig of grapefruit juice straight from the thermos
Hock your jewels, and you can drop your tools
And make a move that can turn us in the right direction

Comin' fly with Mr. Greenjeans

As I greet the many people that I meet with a hello

Artificially sweet
I was deceived by the wrapping
Got caught in your web
And I learned how to bleed
I was prey in your bed
And devoured completely

And it hurts my soul

We both can seduce
But darling you hold me prisoner (prisoner)

And I'm fiendin' for a cure

Leads to one mistake

What did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back

I need to get away from ya

I get smothered in despair, it's never over, over
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare,
I let out a silent prayer
That it be over, over

Begging pleading no more

So sad but it's true

And she said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back to me
In my mind

How can I be strong?
I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions you had many
I know you did

I come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
Never fall again

Making love to you felt so good
And oh so right

How can I be strong?
I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

So here we are alone again
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss

I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
Don't think I can take the pain
Never fall again

Kinda late in the game
And my heart is in your hands
Don't you stand there and then tell me
You love me, then leave again
'Cause I'm falling in love with you again

Hold me, hold me
Don't ever let me go
Say it just one time
Say you love me
God knows I do love you again","['pop', '90s', 'rnb', 'femalevocalists', 'soul', 'r&b', 'Ballad', 'janetjackson', 'Love', 'newjackswing', 'lovesong', 'romantic', 'lovesongs', '1993', 'american', 'ballads', 'again', 'sad', 'Mellow', 'femalevocalist', 'piano', 'rhythmandblues', 'dance', 'favorites', 'chillout', '80s', 'easylistening', 'quietstorm', 'adultcontemporary', 'beautiful', 'relaxing', 'femalevocals', 'top40', 'singalong', '1990s', 'billboardnumberones', '90sRnb', 'usnumberone', 'Soundtrack', 'electronic', 'classic', 'instrumental', 'sexy', 'USA', 'slow', 'synthpop', 'vocaljazz', 'urban', 'strings', 'new', 'randb', 'synthesizer', 'heartbreak', 'Neo-Soul', 'sensual', 'sunset', 'slowjams', 'topartists', 'JamandLewis', 'jacksons', 'lostlove', 'numberonehits', 'Slowdances', 'janet', 'blackartists', 'vh-1', 'janetjackson-AGAIN', 'seenlive', 'female', 'hiphop', 'rock', 'ambient', 'singer-songwriter', 'clean', 'happy', 'acoustic', 'RB', 'funk', 'flute', 'moody', 'girls', 'laidback', 'long', 'sunday', 'lovesong', 'melancholy', 'Sleep', 'nostalgic', 'soft', 'ethereal', 'RainyDay', 'favourite', 'keyboard', 'good', 'crooner', 'softpop', 'songsilove', 'michaeljackson', 'oboe', 'english']",0,1993

Anderson is cold tonight,
The leaves are scattered on the ground
I miss the seasons in the comfort of your smile

Sometimes this song feels like a dream,
I'm waiting for someone just to wake me up from this life
As I look out on these fairgrounds,
I remember how our family split apart

I don't think I ever told you,
But I know you always did your best
In the hard times that only made us stronger

As I sit here all alone,
I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on
When you're gone

I'll never be the same without you,
I love you more than you will ever know
So maybe now you finally know:
Sometimes we're helpless and alone,
But you can't let it keep you weighted down
You must go on

Do you ever feel like crying?
Do you ever feel like giving up?
I raise my hands up towards the sky
And say this prayer for you tonight,
Because nothing is impossible

As I sit here all alone,
I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on
When you're gone

I'll never be the same without you,
I love you more than you will ever know
So maybe now you finally know:
Sometimes we're helpless and alone,
But you can't let it keep you weighted down

It's being content with who we are

Made me hurt

Will don't talk too good

We'd watch him when she had to work late
And we'd all laugh like I hadn't laughed
Since I don't know when

Hey Jude was his favorite song
At dinner he'd ask to pray
And then he'd pray for everybody in the world but him

Before they moved to California
His mother said, they didn't think he'd live
And she said each day that I have him, well it's just
Another gift
And I never got to tell her, that the boy
Showed me the truth

I'm very good with plants
When my friends are away
They let me keep the soil moist
On the seventh day I rest
For a minute or two
Then back on my feet to call for you

You've got cucumbers on your eyes
Too much time spent on nothing
Waiting for a moment to arise
The face in the ceiling
And arms too long
I'm waiting for him to catch me

Waiting for it to embrace me oh","['electronic', 'femalevocalists', 'ambient', 'atmospheric', 'swedish', 'scandinavian', 'electronica', 'chillout', 'experimental', 'synthpop', 'ethereal', 'indie', 'feverray', '2009', 'tribal', 'beautiful', 'indietronica', 'electropop', 'chill', 'alternative', 'downtempo', 'dreampop', '00s', 'creepy', 'genius', 'femalevocalist', 'electro', 'spooky', 'loveatfirstlisten', 'KarinDreijer', 'electricbarbarella', 'tribalsynthpop', 'Love', 'darkerthanthedeepestsea', 'trip-hop', 'dark', 'Experimentalpop', 'weird', 'lounge', 'bestof2009', 'perfecttolistentowhileleavingtheplanet', 'Sweden', 'myneighbourswilllovethis', 'electro-pop', 'high', 'artpop', 'AvantgardePop', 'trippyinsanity', 'mygangrotw', 'perfectbeauty', 'musicIwannahugbutcannothugbecauseitismusicandyoucannothugsounds', 'listenedtooverandover', 'videoclip', 'shutthefuckupandlistenatnight', 'ohsodreamy', 'pulsingbeat', 'lovetosee', 'vugube62', 'female', 'pop', 'favorites', 'ambientpop', 'idm', 'Dreamy', 'scary', 'winter', 'Mellow', 'deep', 'relaxing', 'darkwave', 'femalevocals', 'trippy', 'darkambient', 'interesting', 'Favorite', 'relax', 'fav', 'darkwave', 'Ilovethissong', 'Yay', 'theknife', 'goodmusic', 'KarinDreijerAndersson', 'Silkred-LovedAll', 'SoundtrackOfMyLife', '-favorites-', 'lizvelrene2009', 'PersonalBest', 'emotionallandscapes', 'Karin', 'thereisstillhope', 'whenigrowup', 'siempre', 'SeashellsSymphonies', 'unusal', 'wyzszypoziomzajebistosci', 'PES2011', '-electronic-', 'boty09']",0,2009

So what, so what, so what's the scenario
Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario

Ayo, Bo knows this (what) and Bo knows that (what)
But Bo don't know jack, cause Bo can't rap
Well what do you know, the Di-Dawg is first up to bat
No batteries included, and no strings attached
No holds barred, no time for move faking
Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon
Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe so
Sleep if you want, NyQuil will help you get your Z's, troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some, short, dark and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fuming, I've had it up to here
My days of paying dues are over, acknowledge me as in there (yeah)
Head for the border, go get a taco
Watch me wreck it from the jump street, meaning from the get-go
Sit back, relax and let yourself go
Don't front what you heard, but act like you know

Yes yes, y'all (yes y'all)
Who got the vibe, it's the Tribe y'all (Tribe y'all)
Real live, y'all (live y'all)
Inside, outside, come around
(Who's that) Brown
Some may, I say, call me Charlie
The word is the herb and I'm deep like Bob Marley
Lay back on the payback, evolve, rotate the gates
(Contact) Can I get a hit (hit)
Boom bip with a brother named Tip, and we're ready to flip
East coast stomping, ripping and romping
New York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton
Checka-checka-check it out
The loops for the troops, more bounce to the ounce
And wow how now wow how now, Brown cow
We're ill till the skill gets down
For the flex, next, it's the textbook old to the new
But the rest are doo-doo
From radio to the video to Arsenio
Tell me, yo, what's the scenario

(True blue) Scooby Doo, whoopie doo
Scenarios, radios, rates more than four
Scores for the smores that smother dance floors
Now I go for mine, shades of seashore
Ship-shape crushed grapes, apes that play tapes
Papes make drakes, baked for the wakes
Of an L-ah, and -eader, simply just a leader
Bass in the space means ""peace, see ya later""
Later (later), later alligator
Pop blows the weasel and the herb's the inflator
So yo, the D what the O, incorporate I-N-C into a flow
Funk flipped flat back first this foul fight fight fight
Laugh yo, how'd that sound (ooh)

It's a Leader Quest mission and we got the goods here (here)
Never on the left cause my right's my good ear (ear)
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal
Stay away from crime so I ain't no criminal
I love my young nation, groovy sensation
No time for hibernation, only elation
Don't ever try to test the water, little kid
Yo Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell 'em what I did

I heard you rushed and rushed, and attacked
Then they rebuked, then you had to smack
Causing rambunction throughout the sphere
Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear

You know I did it
So don't violate or you'll get violated
The hip-hop sound is well agitated
Won't ever waste no time on the played out ego
So here's Busta Rhymes with the scenario

Watch as I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come rewind
Powerful impact (boom) from the cannon
Not bragging, try to read my mind, just imagine
Vocabulary's necessary
When digging into my library
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh
Eating Ital Stew like the one Peter Tosh
Uh, uh, uh, all over the track, man
Uh, pardon me, uh, as I come back
As I did it, yo I heard you beg your pardon
When I travel through the town, I roll with the squadron
Roar, roar, like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers cause your pants are sagging
Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban
And have you smelling ripe like some old stale urine
Chickity-choco, the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel, butt cheeks they were kicking
Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme
The rhythm is in sync (uh) the rhymes are on time (time)
Ripping up this dance just like Horatio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario
Yeah, my man, motherafucka

Or is it way back out?

Any place is where she'll be
Any place she'll see you from
Lies and secrets become your world
Anytime, anywhere, she takes me away

And death climbs up the steps one by one
To give you the rose that's been burned by her son

Point me to the sky above
I can't get there on my own
Walk me to the graveyard
Dig up her bones

I have seen the demon's face
I have heard of her death place
I fall down on my knees
In praise of the...
Horrible things that take her away

And death climbs up the steps one by one
To give you the rose that's been burned by her son

Point me to the sky above
I can't get there on my own
Walk me to the graveyard
Dig up her bones
Point me to the sky above
I can't get there on my own
Walk me to the graveyard
Dig up her bones

I don't eat no meat.
No dairy, no sweets.
Only ripe vegtables, fresh fruit and whole wheat.
I'm from the old school, my household smells like soul food, bro.
Curry falafel, barbequed tofu.
No fish, or none of dem candy bars.
No ciggarettes.
Only ganja, and fresh squeezed juice from oranges.
Excerisin' daily, to stay healthy.
An I rarely drink water out the tap 'cause it's filthy.

Lentil soup - is- mental fruit
And, ginger root- is good for the youth.
Fresh vegetables with the ital stew.
Sweet yam fries with the green caleoo
Careful how you season and prepare your foods,
Cause you don't want to lose - vitamins and minerals
And that's the jewel-
Life brings.
Life is valuable, so I eat what comes from the ground- It's natural.
Let your food be your medicine. No exceteran.
Strictly herb, generates from the sun.
'Cause I got MELANIN.
Drink water. 8 glasses a day.
Cause that's what they say.

They say you are what you eat.
So I strive to eat healthy.
My goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy.
Cause true wealth, comes from good health and wise ways.
That's why we gotta start takin' better care of ourselves.

Be Healthy Y'all.

I could have ordinary people chasing me from town to town

They've got a spy for every blink of your eye

I'm feeling awkward
I'm feeling tongue-tied
They've got a knife for every time you take the same train into work
A family's like a loaded gun
You point it in the wrong direction someone's gonna get killed

If you had such a dream
Would you get up and do the things you believed in?

Is he your husband?
Or just your boyfriend?
Is he the moron who's been beating you and keeping you inside?
I've never done this kind of thing
But if I kill him now, well who's going to miss him?

I went up to the school
I took a walk up Castlehill
For every step there was a local boy who wants to be a hero
Do you wanna do it now?
Outside the butcher's with a knife and a bike chain

Woman speaking in background (from ""Rip Van Winkle"" by Washington Irving):

""Times grew worse and worse with Rip Van Winkle as years of matrimony rolled on; a tart tempter never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue is the only edge tool that grows keener by constant use. For a long while he used to console himself, when driven from home, by frequenting a kind of perpetual club of the sages, philosophers, and other idle personages of the village, which held its sessions on a bench before a small inn, designated by a rubicund portrait of his majesty George the Third. Here they used to sit in the shade, through a long lazy summer's day, talking listlessly over village gossip, or telling endless sleepy stories about nothing. But it would have been worth any statesman's money to have heard the profound discussions that sometimes took place, when by chance an old newspaper fell into their hands, from some passing traveller. How solemnly they would listen to the contents, as drawled out by Derrick Van Bummel, the schoolmaster, a dapper learned little man, who was not to be daunted by the most gigantic word in the dictionary...""","['indie', 'indiepop', 'Scottish', 'twee', 'pop', 'belleandsebastian', 'alternative', 'rock', 'chamberpop', 'britishilike', 'amayzesloved', 'indierock', 'tweepop', 'davaho53', 'vugube62', 'seenlive', 'british', 'folk', 'malevocalists', 'octwoct', 'classic', 'epic', 'singersongwriter', 'bop', 'britpop', 'krautrock', 'upbeat', 'glasgow', 'Radio', 'literate', 'Mellow', 'gay', 'melancholy', 'amazing', 'RainyDay', 'nice', 'shoegazer', 'Favourites', 'english', 'Loveit', 'gdchills90s', 'favoritetracks', 'art', 'Dream', 'emusic', 'danceparty', 'Dancable', 'dreams', '1996', 'james', 'dancy', 'election', 'songsthatmakemehappy', 'goodsong', 'bedroomdancing', 'artpop', 'singable', 'songsIabsolutelylove', 'Alltimefavourite', 'stardust', 'mysoundtrack', 'Docaralho', 'scottishindie', 'RichB', 'niceandcosy', 'session', 'scot', 'bs', 'wickedbass', 'comepickmeup', 'songsaboutbikes', 'nataliciouspartaychoonz', 'AlternativeTwee', 'woozily', 'yayandhoorayandyippeeandhuzzah', 'butIlikeit', 'kk', '0o', 'iloveyoustuartmurdoch', 'delicia', 'music1', 'OnlyInDreams', 'recentstuffincludingwhitestripesandportishead', 'groove-tastic', 'britishlove', 'whatindieshouldbelike', 'Tigermilk', 'funnydances', 'steveadamsfm', 'TemasCrema', 'shesarainbow', 'thestationthatneversleeps', 'TopPlayedTracks', 'strongmemories', 'bellesebastian', 'GoodinawayIcantevenbelieve', 'singuk', 'Wordpuppet', 'beautindie', 'amazingalbumcoverslmfaoveryxxhardcorexxshitlol-laughsveryhardforaboutthelengthofthesong-']",1,1996

Drops onto the forehead of the waiting boy,
He surveys his rental kingdom and he,
Wonders if he's really lost his one joy.

Another fool would go down to the,
Only place she ever went to lose herself,
She's gone to the movies now and she,
Don't need your help.

Now the rain turns into snowfall as the,
City sky reflects the silver street below,
And it covers up the cars,
And the Wall-flowers CD ended half an hour ago.

Another fool would dig the broken car out from the snow,
And drive to find the show,
She's gone to the movies now and she's,
Not coming home,
She's gone to the movies now and she's,
Not coming home.

Now he looks around his place and anyways,
There's nowhere she could sit besides the bed,
And he wonders if the car will start tomorrow,
Or he'll have to take the bus instead.

Any other fool would be out on the roadway,
Trying to spot her rusted Pontiac,
She's gone to the movies now and she's,
Not coming back,
She's gone to the movies now and she's,

I'm fitted for a heat-resistant sleeve
Keep your distance please
Your persona's in question my phosphorescent skin
Makes your heat pistons freeze
I'm a hallucinogen pez-dispenser, led ventures
With a group of umpla-lumpa parachute troopers
Who discredit theories and behead your mentors
Who can radio wave windsurf to invert what is common knowledge
I will insert my solemn promise to style until my limbs burst
Negotiate with marketing consultants, giving me the once-over
Wearing grim smirks
They would like me to convert my gritty edge
To unearth my earning potential
But my face is so sun burnt
Due to all the grassroots grunt work
That I won't be co-opted
And every photo-op needs to be photoshopped cropped and snipped
But I'm a street vendor kinds sir
This style-free is dopamine
It's a meat tenderizer at the gallery opening

You can join my suicide cult
Membership is free
Take these cyanide eye-drops
And peppermint hemlock

When I'm racing in carpool lane
To sell shit to an art school lame
-Don't you think you're hot shit
Well what do you have to offer-
A dead archetype able to be purchased on a credit card swipe
But they can they pinpoint and nail
My distance between art and commerce
With just an invoice of a sale
I will disappoint an ail
Those who want to deny us the majority rule
When a will jump in my primordial pool
Without knowing where their swim trunks were
But not everyone knows
What they're called on to encumber
You can't know by just logging on with a pin number

I can do it blindfolded with no road atlas
Unrelated to your three-legged
Preachy bootleggers will do away with you
CD duplicators make vegans
Do the salad bar swing-pivot
Wave your valid parking tickets
At the endangered sea-urchin
Tell me the name of your political activist key person
And I'll tell you what's under the blips of the clean version
Of the infamous rap rant
Trickling down the baggy pant leg
Of this unhappy class aid
Covered in shell fragments of this
Graffiti tagged glass egg

Your cheeks a shade of pink
And the rest of you in powder blue

But I'll make you this guarantee

No one wants to be alone at Christmas time

In the dark, on the phone
You tell me the names of your brothers
And your favorite colors

And when it snows again
We'll take a walk outside
And search the sky
Like children do

Making new resolutions a hundred times

And look around at all the beautiful houses

Hey yo, this song is for anyone... fuck it, just shut up and listen
Hey yo

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences gettin' this stress
That's been eatin' me recently off of this chest

And I rest again peacefully (peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter

To not come and speak to me (speak to me)
I don't know you and no, I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-ing thing
I'm not Mr. *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick

If you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet (10 feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you

Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of arguin' (of arguin)
I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be, it's just me

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content.
That song ""Guilty Conscience"" has gotten such rotten responses.""

And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinky

Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school

And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see an upper class city

Havin' this happenin' (this happenin' )
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name Is""

And pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
That copped me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)
To deal with these cocky caucasians

Who think, I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?

The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
Till I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (ahhh)
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (me crazy)

As the evening sky grew dark
She looked at him and he felt a spark
Tingle to his bones
'Twas then he felt alone
And wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate

They walked alone by the old canal
A little confused, I remember well
And stopped into a strange hotel
With a neon burning bright
He felt the heat of the night
Hit him like a freight-
Train moving with a simple twist of fate

A saxophone someplace far off played
As she was walking on by the arcade
As the light bust through a beat up shade
Where he was waking up
She dropped a coin into the cup
Of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate

He woke up; the room was bare
He didn't see her anywhere
He told himself he didn't care
Pushed the window open wide
Felt an emptiness inside
To which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate

He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks
Where the sailors all come in
Maybe she'll pick him out again
How long must he wait
One more time for a simple twist of fate

People tell me it's a sin
To know and feel too much within
I still believe she was my twin
But I lost the ring
She was born in spring
But I was born too late

Could've drowned in it
Woulda floated bloated, voted sugar coated
Loaded hip shooter

Draw for the poor
Free coffee at the banks
sip through the straw
None more for me, thanks

That blanks the raw
That dank sure stank lit
Sank passed the pit
For more hardcore prank spit

Crank it on blast

Blew the whole spot

Spoken:
Dre, just let it run.
Hey yo, turn the beat up a little bit
Hey yo, this song is for anyone... fuck it, just shut up and listen
Hey yo

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences gettin' this stress
That's been eatin' me recently off of this chest

And I rest again peacefully (peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter

To not come and speak to me (speak to me)
I don't know you and no, I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-ing thing
I'm not Mr. *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick

If you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet (10 feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you

Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of arguin' (of arguin)
I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be, it's just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content.
That song ""Guilty Conscience"" has gotten such rotten responses.""

And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinky

Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school

And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see an upper class city

Havin' this happenin' (this happenin' )
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name Is""

And pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
That copped me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)
To deal with these cocky caucasians

Who think, I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?

The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
Till I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (ahhh)
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (me crazy)
I can't take it, I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

Leaves you with a fever

Wondering in the sun

Wandering aimlessly
Is it empty streets, or empty me?

Of this old town
Make me a promise
This will all come back around

TRAIPST128F9302AE9.h5,Eminem,Beautiful,"Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out for you

I'm just so fuckin' depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump, but I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps, fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up in order for me to pick the mic back up

I don't know how or why or when, I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm startin' to feel distant again, so I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet

And I know some shit's so hard to swallow, but I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact, I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow, but you'd have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

I think I'm startin' to lose my sense of humor, everything's so tense and gloom I
Almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room, just as soon as I
Walk in, it's like all eyes on me and so I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that, then it opens the door for conversation, like I want that

I'm not lookin' for extra attention, I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room, maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant, tryin' to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack and half of 'em ain't even funny like ""Hah!

Marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, Goddamn!""
Unfortunately I am, I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down, listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

In my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see, what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

Nobody asked for life to deal us, with these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves and flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now I could have either just sat on my ass and pissed an' moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in and get up and get my own

I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
Or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in, in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid, even if it meant actin' stupid

Aunt Edna always told me, ""Keep makin' that face, it'll get stuck like that""
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there, holdin' my tongue tryin' to talk like this
Till I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then 'cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no more

But I already told you my whole life story, not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where your sittin' it's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each others' shoes at least
What size you wear, I wear 10's, let's see if you can fit your feet

In my shoes just to see what it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own. (Oh)
Everybody has their private world, where they can be alone. (So)
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through? (Oh)
Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out for you. (So)

Spoken
Yeah, to my babies, stay strong. Dad'll be home soon.
And to the rest of the world, God gave you them shoes, to fit you.
So put 'em on and wear 'em.

If birds flying south is a sign of changes
At least you can predict this every year
Love, you never know the minute it ends suddenly
I can't get it to speak
Maybe finding all the things it took to save us
I could fix the pain that bleeds inside of me
Look in your eyes to see something about me
I'm standing on the edge and I don't know what else to give

How can I love you, how can I love you
If you just don't talk to me, babe?

I flow through my act
This question, is she needed?
And decide all the man I can ever be
Looking at the last 3 years like I did
I could never see us ending like this
(Do you know?) Seeing your face no more on my pillow
Is a scene that's never ever happened to me

Stout they stand above the water's edge

Cold stone
Formed only by winds and time
How invulnerable
Lifeless

Ah...
I have longed to be at one with this
Yet, the waters call my name

For once I wish to see
The entity behind the voice
The face of this seduction
The beauty of my pain

Am I blessed or am I cursed by thy presence?
What is my crime?
What is my deed?
Is this life my redemption?
Shall I repent or proceed?

I hate my flesh
Its dimension poisoned my soul with doubt
It made me question the essence of...
The 'I'

Slaves are those of this world
Given freedom to lay the chains upon The Master
The wolf is no longer free
Release the chains and come for me

Suddenly, his mournful cries were stunned.
Out of the cold mist came three enthralling ships.
Sails torn by many a storm, and the bows adorned by the
Most fierce gargoyles he'd ever laid eyes upon. Yet, the
Crew they bore... Three times twelve in numbers. They
Stood motionless, wrapped in grey, worn gowns.
And from behind their shadowed faces the seductive chanting.
Bidding him on board. without hesitation, he accepted.
And away they sailed...

Upon these seas
Wherein I drowned so many times
I scatter the ashes of destiny
Still my flame is in hunger

With fire in my heart
Shall I greet the shores ahead
Though, I know not what will burn...

Desire...

Ah...
In the distance
I hear the waves wash over solid ground
And in this moment I am struck blind

Grant me sight so I can see
That which lies ahead of me
Cursed be my mortal eyes
For dying in this realm of death

Hear my call...

Blessed she in aching silence- eternal loss
Calling out ""I won't surrender""
A locket of her hair
Sympathize her pious pleasures
Go down the stairs into the dark again
To feel alive again, and wait for
Real love
Or is it me you're after
Is it time?
Because it's now or never
Real love
Real love forever
Real love
Born of the ball and chain
Into a world sustained with sorrow
Real love
A real touch we speak in
Is it lies.
Or is what we're seeking
Real love
In the eyes
Behold and you'll find the 21st century
Detonate her will and her widowed speech
Buried in the backyard shadow
The rusty coffee tin
That held her mother's first kiss in a
Nameless dream
Fall down the stairs again
To feel alive against tomorrow
Real love
Or is it me you're after
Is it time
'Cause it's now or never
Real love
Real love forever
Is it love
Or just yours to treasure
Real love
Real love
Real love
We never listen
Real love will listen
And tell her of my fortune
Real love is riches
Scratch through the changes
Real love is nameless
So tired and hopeless
Real love is painless
Nobody mentions
We ever move to collect
The solar questions
Demon scorn should not relax
The laws of gravity

And that was the turning point
That was one lonely night

The storm maker says it ain't so bad
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, ""Everybody look down
It's all in your mind""

Well, now I'm back at home and
I'm looking forward to this life I live
You know it's gonna haunt me
Some hesitation to this life I give

You think you might cross over
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
You better look it over
Before you make that leap

And you know I'm fine
But I hear those voices at night
Sometimes they justify my claim

And the public don't dwell on my transmission
'Cause it wasn't televised
But it was a turning point
Oh, what a lonely night

The storm maker says it ain't so bad
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, ""Everybody look down
It's all in your mind""

Were spent by the telephone

Just a wishful dream could be blown away

With hard working security guards

In Paris on winter nights
Beneath a snowy veil?

People who change for no reason at all, it's happening all of the time
Can I go on with this train of events disturbing and purging my mind?
Back out of my duties, when all's said and done. I know that I'll lose every time

Moving along in our God-given ways, safety is sat by the fire
Sanctuary from these feverish smiles, left with a mark on the door
Is this the gift that I wanted to give? Forgive and forget's what they teach
Or pass through the deserts and wastelands once more and watch as they drop by the beach

Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all,
Or if he moves will he fall?
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?

He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge

Fills his victims full of dread

I wanna tell you a little story about a party in this song...

It happened back in '93, in the PITTSBURG PUNK ROCK SCENE
An event that will go down, in infamy
It was all the masterplan, of one legendary PUNK ROCK KID
His name was ""Spaz"", S-P-A-Z

An eviction notice to his house sparked off an idea
""I should have one last party at my place...""
So off he set with his master plan, the invitation in his hand read:
""You're invited to my House Destruction Party!""

Spaz's House Destruction Party, it was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough to make the House Destruction Party then you know
You're lucky that you lived

Let's go!

We played there St. Patrick's Day with Submachine and THE BAD GENES
In a basement full of debris
From kicked in doors, broken glass, knocked in walls, THE PLACE WAS THRASHED
The house was now missing it's support beams

The bathrooms had no toilets or sinks left in them
There was nothing in the kitchen left to break
Aus Rotten spray painted on the walls, drunk punks passed out in the halls
And this was just the second night of the three-day long party

Spaz's House Destruction Party, it was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough to make the House Destruction Party then you know
You're lucky that you lived

The cops showed up and all the kids went piling out the back
I remember running away and hiding out in the lot behind the Squirrel Hill Mellon Bank
The cop said, ""I wanna speak to someone who lives here!"" and this punk kid said she did
He asked, ""Is this the condition the house has always been in?""
She answered, ""Uh... yeah, it is.""

And as the day was dawning, my plane flew away
With all the things caught in my mind

I don't wanna be there when you're coming down
I don't wanna be there when you hit the ground
So don't go away
Say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and a day
In the time of my life
'Cause I need more time
Yes I need more time
Just to make things right

Damn my situation and the games I have to play
With all the things caught in my mind
Damn my education, I can't find the words to say
With all the things caught in my mind

I don't wanna be there when you're coming down
I don't wanna be there when you hit the ground
So don't go away
Say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and a day
In the time of my life
'Cause I need more time
Yes I need more time
Just to make things right

Me and you, what's going on?
All we seem to know is how to show
The feelings that are wrong

So don't go away
Say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and a day
In the time of my life
'Cause I need more time
Yes I need more time
Just to make things right

And don't go away
Say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and a day
In the time of my life

Yes I need more time
Just to make things right
Yes I need more time
Just to make things right

I said I was back home, but I'm far away

There ain't no way to know me

But now they feel like, oh yeah they feel like Mondays 

And all my senses seem to shine through the day 
Seem to shine through the day, honey that's okay 
Yes all my senses seem to shine in the night 
Seem to shine in the night, honey that's alright 

In your heart girl, I see a jealous butterfly 
You wanted me high, love, but I'm sober still 
In your heart girl, there's nothing left but misery 
Come dance while I'm getting free I'm gonna lie again 

Cause there ain't no point in the words I write 
There ain't no way to get me 
But I sure was high when I saw your smile 
But now you're always, oh yes you're always gone girl

The very first time I touched your skin I thought of a story and rushed to reach the end too soon
Oh, remember. Oh, please don't change

So the fall came, thirteen years, a shiny ring and how I could forget your name
The air no longer in my throat, another perfect lie is choked but it always feels the same

So they close together, dressed in red and yellow, innocent forever. Sleeping children in their blue soft rooms still dream

I want to be a forester
Run through the moss on high heels
That's what I'll do
Throwing out a boomerang
Waiting for it to come back to me

When I grow up
I want to live near the sea
Crab claws and bottles of rum
That's what I'll have
Staring at the seashell
Waiting for it to embrace me

I put my soul in what I do
Last night I drew a funny man
With dog eyes and a hanging tongue
It goes way bad
I never like that sad look
From someone who wants to be loved by you

I'm very good with plants
When my friends are away
They let me keep the soil moist
On the seventh day I rest
For a minute or two
Then back on my feet to call for you

You've got cucumbers on your eyes
Too much time spent on nothing
Waiting for a moment to arise
The face in the ceiling
And arms too long
I'm waiting for him to catch me

Teeter-tottered on the top of patent leather shoes
I happened to catch her and said
""Maybe these ruby shoes are a little cumbersome for you.""
Maybe for you, now

But not as shaky as I must have seemed
Talking junk through her giggle little teenage dream
And on the phone I could not compete
My dumb luck fake confidence was getting weak
And for a sec', I thought I sounded sweet
But sure enough in a gruff, faint voice
I heard myself speak

I could stay a while
But sooner or later, I'll break your smile
And I can tell a joke
But one of these days, I'm bound to choke

And we could share a kiss
But I feel like I can't go through with this
And I bet we could build a home
But I know the right thing for me to do
Is to leave you alone
Leave you alone, now

I'm beginning to like you
So you probably won't get what I'm going to do
I'm walkin' away from you

Leave you alone, now

And say I'm doing exactly what a coward would do
And I'm beginning to like you
It's a shame, what a lame way to live, but what can I do?
I hope you appreciate what I do

Now there's no one left to hold today,
You know what they say

When your heart is bleeding it'll heel in time,
But what if I myself am guilty of the crime,
'Cause I see

I didn't realize I had it all,
Instead I chose to take a fall,
Now it's all the same,
And I've me to blame
Now I'm left alone with my shame,
Left with all my shame

Painful whispers,
Shouting in my head,
Things that were bright yellow,
Are now black instead

I had a secret meeting with a strange desire,
I couldn't get enough it only took me higher,
Now I see

I didn't realize they had it all,
Instead I chose to take a fall,
Now it's all the same,
And I've me to blame,
Now I'm left alone with my shame

The picture of us on the window seal,
It's not replaced with dust,
And your fingerprints are gone,
And now loneliness is a friend of mine

I didn't realize they had it all,
Instead I chose to take a fall,
Now it's all the same,
And I've me to blame

I didn't realize they had it all,
Instead I chose to take a fall,
Now it's all the same,
And I've me to blame,
Now I'm left alone with my shame,

A reason to fight is not making a stronger man

I won't calm down! I won't calm down!

Move! I shout it out loud!
We're radical and we're proud of it...


Change the things - together we stand and load the gun and make 'em swing'!
Love is a wonderful thing - a secret - a game
And I sing the song of freedom to hate!
Try to think international!

There's no place where no one gets hurt...
A place where I can be on my own!
You should feel guilty if you're just watching!
There's this pain and a constant sound in my head...
They always try and get you back to what they define as reality!
There's nothing to lose but watch your back!

The garden swells with a thousand more wise
Forever flung to celestial dreams
Clawing at the grave of the dead Nazarene

I watch the storm approaching
The darkness calls my name
The trees are growing restless
They feel the season change
Their fruit has putrefied
Forbidden once and bound to die
The thread of life lies severed
On the brink of paradise

Grinning winds of hate unfurled
Towers tall that grip the sun
Talons stretch 'neath her veil
Reclamation, our time has come
Our time has come

Autumn spreads its golden wings
And lays the path for those unseen
A tangled web of evil spun at last
Winter spawn from barren thighs
To readdress, to slay the blind
And throw the reins untethered to the skies

They pray to the full moon rising
Diana moving with such infinite grace
Wrapped alone in a blanket of nightfall
How many secrets can they read by your face?

Will they know of majesty
Of beauty held in dream-dead sleep
And scarlet seas that bleed the frozen shores?
Will their God of bridled love
Assuage our rule from planes above
Or shrink in fear from chaos roused for war?

War!

Wrest askew the nails
That have held you, lurking deep
September prayers are waning
Burn the shrines of fettered sheep
Spearhead the insurrection
Of a world that seeks no end
We are what we are, what we shall be, again
Again

Appear; draped in terror
To the comfort of your kin
Stain the milky sunset red
And let the others

Two hearts broken
And a third will soon falter
Now too late, I know that we
Were wrong to part

We can't go back and start anew
Now too late, I've thrown away
My chance of happiness with you

Were wrong to part

Take a calendar and turn back all the pages
Take my life, turn back each day since I was born

Holding my pillow tight
I know that I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes
To face reality
Every moment without you
It seems like eternity

And I want it with you

Don't ever let it go

It can heal all things
We won't hurt any more
No I don't believe our love's terminal

You don't have to call me lieutenant Rosie and I don't want to be your son
The only lover I'm ever gonna need's your soft sweet little girl's tongue
And Rosie you're the one

Dynamite's in the belfry playin' with the bats
Little Gun's downtown in front of Woolworth's tryin' out his attitude on all the cats

Senorita come sit by my fire
I just want to be your lover ain't no liar,
Rosalita you're my stone desire

Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they're gonna be there
Ah Sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool,
Stay out all night, it's gonna feel all right

Closets are for hangers, winners use the door

And I know your daddy he don't dig me but he never did understand
Your papa lowered the boom he locked you in your room
I'm comin' to lend a hand
I'm comin' to liberate you, confiscate you, I want to be your man
Someday we'll look back on this and it will all seem funny
But now you're sad, your mama's mad
And your papa says he knows that I don't...
(...Have any money)
Oh, your papa says he knows...
(...That I don't have any money)
Oh, so your daddy says he knows that I don't have...
(...Any money)
Well, tell him this is last chance
To get his daughter in a fine romance
Because a record company Rosie just gave me a big advance

And my tires were slashed and I almost crashed but the Lord had mercy
And my machine she's a dud out stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey
Well, hold on tight, stay up all night 'cause Rosie I'm comin' on strong
By the time we meet the morning light I will hold you in my arms
I know a pretty little place in Southern California down San Diego way
There's a little cafe where they play guitars all night and all day
You can hear them in the back room strummin'
So hold tight baby 'cause don't you know daddy's comin'

In the night, in the night

Want the same thing when we lay
Otherwise mine's a different way
A different way from where I'm going

So sorry if I turn my head

Yours is a familiar face
But that don't make your place safe
In my bed, my bed, my bed

I never thought my memory
Of what we had could be intruded
But I couldn't let it be
I needed it as much as you did

Now it's not hard to understand
Why we just speak at night 
The only time I hold your hand
Is to get the angle right

Te regalo mi cintura,
Y mis labios para cuando quieras besar,
Te regalo mi locura
Y las pocas neuronas que quedan ya.

El diario en el que escribo,
Te doy hasta mis suspiros,
Pero no te vayas más,
Porque eres tú mi sol,
La fe con que vivo,
La potencia de mi voz,
Los pies con que camino,
Eres tú, amor,
Mis ganas de reírme,
El adiós que no sabré decir 
Porque nunca podré vivir sin ti.
Si algún día decidieras,
Alejarte nuevamente de aquí,
Cerraría cada puerta,
Para que nunca pudieras salir.

Te regalo mi nariz,
Yo te doy hasta mis huesos,
Pero quédate aquí,
Porque eres tú mi sol,

and my lips, for when you want to kiss,
I give you my madness
and the few neurons they left me

but don't leave anymore

Because you are, my sun, the faith with I live
the strength of my voice
the feet I use to walk.
It is you my love, my desires to live
the goodbye I don't know how to say 
because I will be never able to live without you

If one of these day you would decide to get away from me
I would close every door, so you could never go out
I give you my silence, I give you my nose,
I give you even my bones, but stay here.

Because you are, my sun, the faith with I live
the strength of my voice
the feet I use to walk.

Too many choices
In New York I found a friend
To drown out the other voices

Voices on the cell phone
Voices from home
Voices of the hard sell
Voices down the stairwell
In New York, just got a place in New York

In New York summers get hot
Well into the hundreds
You can't walk around the block
Without a change of clothing

Hot as a hairdryer in your face
Hot as a handbag and a can of mace
New York, I just got a place in New York
New York, New York

In New York you can forget
Forget how to sit still
Tell yourself you will stay in
But it's down to Alphaville

New York, New York, New York
New York, New York, New York

The Irish have been coming here for years
Feel like they own the place
They got the airport, city hall, concrete, asphalt
They even got the police

Irish, Italian, Jews and Hispanics
Religious nuts, political fanatics in the stew
Living happily not like me and you
That's where I lost you New York

New York, New York
New York, New York

In New York I lost it all
To you and your vices
Still I'm staying on to figure out
My midlife crisis

I hit an iceberg in my life
But you know I'm still afloat
You lose your balance, lose your wife
In the queue for the lifeboat

You got to put the women and children first
But you've got an unquenchable thirst for New York

New York, New York
New York, New York

In the stillness of the evening
When the sun has had its day
I heard your voice whispering
""Come away, child""

I'm goin' down in the town where my name is all around

I'm passin a natural ten or four or six or eight before I go
Yes, I'm definitely freestylin, all the while still profilin
Never a trickster, DJ Quikster steals the show

(Where you from, fool?)

Now Compton is the place where the homeboys chill, you see
But then I found that it wasn't no place for me
Cause way back in the day somebody musta wanted me to quit
Because they broke in my house and cold stole my shit
They musta thought that I was gonna play the punk role
Just because my equipment got stole
But I ain't goin' out like no sucker-ass clown
They found they couldn't keep a dope nigga down
So here's some bass in your face, muthafucka silly sucker-
Ass clocker, now you're duckin, cause you can't stop a brother
Like the Quiksta, because I'm true to the game
You're lame, and things ain't gonn' never be the same
Cause a nigga like the Quik is takin' over
I really don't think I should have to explain
It, oh yeah, I'm a dog, but my name ain't Rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feelin' no pain
Sometimes I have to wear a bullet-proof vest
Because I got the 'Cpt' sign written across my chest
A funky dope brother never ceases to impress
My name is DJ Quik, so you can fuck the rest
I'm comin' like this, and I'm comin' directly
Cause suckers get dain-bramaged if I'm doin' damage quite effectively
Rhymin is a battlezone, and suckers have no win
'Cause I'm a veteran from the C-o-m-p-t-o-n

Legends of Lusitanian pride
He sings the words I cannot spring

At the Moon Mountain six wolves cry
Your lost glory we'll regain or die

For I am her only child
And she is my dearest mystery
Pagan Gods in conspiracy
For the sword of Tyranny

Mother Tongue has spoke to thee
In the strongest way they've ever seen
World can't you see ?
I am not alone in my belief.

Virando costas ao Mundo
Orgulhosamente sós
Glória Antiga, volta a nós!

ALMA MATER!

Mother Tongue has spoke to Me
In the strongest way I've ever seen
I know that she sees in Me
Her proudest child, her purest breed

She speaks to Me in colours
I can't really understand
I only know that they are ours
And to those I'll proudly bend

For I am her only child
And she is my dearest mystery
From an ancient throne I defy the world
To kneel before the powers within.

For I am her only child
And she is my dearest tragedy
World can't you see it?
I am not alone in my belief.

Virando costas ao Mundo
Orgulhosamente sós
Glória Antiga, volta a nós!

In the rain there are wonders left to touch
So you're reaching out

Hold on to me while I
Hold on to my Father's hand
(God will heal you, make you, like new)
Time will bring you to

So the flowers grow and bloom in the desert sand
And the crystal tears they fall and flower in a barren land
Till you feel the sunlight shining on your skin

The smell of the warm summer air
I live in a town where you can't smell a thing
You watch your feet for cracks in the pavement

High up above aliens hover
Making home movies for the folks back home
Of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets

They're all uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight

I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when I'm driving
Take me on board their beautiful ship
Show me the world as I'd love to see it

I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely
I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
They'd shut me away
But I'd be all right
All right
I'm all right
All right

Keep on aching the same heartbreak

I want to be a forester
Run through the moss on high heels
That's what I'll do
Throwing out a boomerang
Waiting for it to come back to me

When I grow up
I want to live near the sea
Crab claws and bottles of rum
That's what I'll have
Staring at the seashell
Waiting for it to embrace me

I put my soul in what I do
Last night I drew a funny man
With dog eyes and a hanging tongue
It goes way bad
I never like that sad look
From someone who wants to be loved by you

I'm very good with plants
When my friends are away
They let me keep the soil moist
On the seventh day I rest
For a minute or two
Then back on my feet to call for you

You've got cucumbers on your eyes
Too much time spent on nothing
Waiting for a moment to arise
The face in the ceiling
And arms too long
I'm waiting for him to catch me

Waiting for it to embrace me oh","['electronic', 'femalevocalists', 'ambient', 'atmospheric', 'swedish', 'scandinavian', 'electronica', 'chillout', 'experimental', 'synthpop', 'ethereal', 'indie', 'feverray', '2009', 'tribal', 'beautiful', 'indietronica', 'electropop', 'chill', 'alternative', 'downtempo', 'dreampop', '00s', 'creepy', 'genius', 'femalevocalist', 'electro', 'spooky', 'loveatfirstlisten', 'KarinDreijer', 'electricbarbarella', 'tribalsynthpop', 'Love', 'darkerthanthedeepestsea', 'trip-hop', 'dark', 'Experimentalpop', 'weird', 'lounge', 'bestof2009', 'perfecttolistentowhileleavingtheplanet', 'Sweden', 'myneighbourswilllovethis', 'electro-pop', 'high', 'artpop', 'AvantgardePop', 'trippyinsanity', 'mygangrotw', 'perfectbeauty', 'musicIwannahugbutcannothugbecauseitismusicandyoucannothugsounds', 'listenedtooverandover', 'videoclip', 'shutthefuckupandlistenatnight', 'ohsodreamy', 'pulsingbeat', 'lovetosee', 'vugube62', 'female', 'pop', 'favorites', 'ambientpop', 'idm', 'Dreamy', 'scary', 'winter', 'Mellow', 'deep', 'relaxing', 'darkwave', 'femalevocals', 'trippy', 'darkambient', 'interesting', 'Favorite', 'relax', 'fav', 'darkwave', 'Ilovethissong', 'Yay', 'theknife', 'goodmusic', 'KarinDreijerAndersson', 'Silkred-LovedAll', 'SoundtrackOfMyLife', '-favorites-', 'lizvelrene2009', 'PersonalBest', 'emotionallandscapes', 'Karin', 'thereisstillhope', 'whenigrowup', 'siempre', 'SeashellsSymphonies', 'unusal', 'wyzszypoziomzajebistosci', 'PES2011', '-electronic-', 'boty09']",0,2009

Hit the wall,
Scream out loud,
As you start to crawl
Back in your cage
The only place
Where they will
Leave you alone.
'Cause the weak will
Seek the weaker till they've broken them.
Could you get it back again?
Would it be the same?
Fulfillment to their lack of strength at your expense,
Left you with no defense;
They tore it down.

And I have felt the same as you,
I've felt the same as you,
I've felt the same.

Locked inside
The only place
Where you feel sheltered,
Where you feel safe.
You lost yourself
In your search to find
Something else to hide behind.

The fearful always preyed upon your confidence.
Did they see the consequence,
When they pushed you around?
The arrogant build kingdoms made of the different ones,
Breaking them till they've become just another crown.

Refuse to feel anything at all,
Refuse to slip,
Refuse to fall.
Can't be weak,
Can't stand still,
You watch your back 'cause no one will.
You don't know why they had to go this far,
Traded your worth for these scars,
For your only company.
And don't believe the lies
That they have told to you. Not one word was true
You're all right, you're all right, you're all right.","['rock', 'alternative', 'Lifehouse', 'alternativerock', 'christian', 'simon', 'chill', 'indie', 'sad', 'Mellow', 'nice', 'greatlyrics', 'pop', 'poprock', 'favorites', 'epic', 'beautiful', 'american', 'emotional', '00s', 'Ballad', 'Favourites', 'altrock', 'christianalternative', 'breakmyheart', 'sosadandlonely', 'seenlive', 'albumsIown', 'USA', 'calm', 'Love', 'softrock', 'romantic', 'Awesome', 'moody', 'peace', 'haunting', 'normal', 'amazing', 'spiritual', 'christianrock', 'favourite', 'quiet', 'good', 'malevocalist', 'malevocalists', 'buy', 'depression', 'Favorite', 'best', 'chillout', 'import', '8of10stars', 'sweet', 'pain', 'life', '2000s', 'light', '6of10stars', '2000', 'depressive', 'aternative', 'Awesomesong', 'Greatest', 'adultalternativerock', 'bestever', 'rockingout', 'relationships', 'derb', 'slower', 'amigos', 'baaa-you-tiful', 'ohsosad', 'calma', 'Rustig', 'amei', 'bpluscoop', 'higor', 'myloved', 'WMList', 'GreatestArtists', 'stillgood', 'holdmetonight', 'tportal', 'quotethis', 'jrhighman', '90coop', 'ninamyers', 'thablackphoenix', 'fideist', 'july10', 'mainstreamradio', 'simijimi', 'stoon', 'ostfrankgardy', 'MuseRadio', 'landoalt1', 'songtitleswithmalenames', 'zuvin', 'Sday']",0,2000

She said, ""Be true to yourself and you can't go wrong.
But there's just one thing that you must understand.
You can fool with your brother
But don't mess with a missionary man.
Don't mess with a missionary man
Don't mess with a missionary man
Don't mess with a missionary man.""

Oh, the missionary man, he's got God on his side
He's got the saints and apostles backing up from behind
Black eyed looks from those Bible books
He's a man with a mission, got a serious mind

There was a woman in the jungle and a monkey on a tree
The missionary man, he was following me
He said, ""Stop what you're doing, get down upon your knees.
I've a message for you that you better believe.""

Ah yeah
Hey
Uh
Hey, uh

Well I was born an original sinner
I was borne from original sin
And if I had a dollar bill for all the things I've done
There'd be a mountain of money

Will petrify the weak

Nobody... (Nobody!...)
Nobody

Your pain is so deep rooted
What will your life become
Sure you hide it
But you're lost and lonesome
Still just a frail shook one

Who's gonna love you
When it all falls down, and
(Tell me who's gonna love you? Who? I'd like to know)
Who's gonna love you when
Your bankroll runs out
(If you didn't have nothing)
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over
(Who, who'd still be there)
When the star of the show isn't you anymore
(Nobody, nobody, nobody, oh)
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown
(There ain't nobody baby)
Fall down...
(I guess your mama never told you what
Goes around comes back around)
(Bullies in the schoolyard)
(When they fall they fall hard)
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown
(Yeah... so you)
Fall down
(I guess your mama never told you what
Goes around comes back around)
(Better think twice, better play nice)
('Cause who's gonna be there)

Who's gonna love you when it all falls down, and
(When the jokes on you)
Who's gonna love you when your bankroll runs out
(A marionette show)
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over
(Who's makin' you move though)
When the star of the show isn't you anymore
(I know what kills you slow)
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown
(I'm gonna keep your little secret though)
Fall down
(I guess your mama never told you what
Goes around comes back around)
(Mmmm, hmmmm)
(And you know that I know)
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown
(You're no superhero)
Fall down...
(I guess your mamma never told you that
What goes around comes back around)

That when you throw your love away
You act as if you just don't care
You look as if you're going somewhere

But I just can't convince myself
I couldn't live with no one else
And I can only play that part
And sit and nurse my broken heart

So lonely, so lonely, so lonely
So lonely, so lonely, so lonely

A wound unhealing

Time now to spread your wings
To take to flight
The life endeavor
Aim for the burning sun
You're trapped inside
But you can still be free...
If time will set you free...
But it's a long long way to go

Keep moving way up high
You see the light
It shines forever
Sail through the crimson skies
The purest light
The light that sets you free...
If time will set you free...

Sail through the wind and rain tonight
You're free to fly tonight

And go high like the wind don't stop

Spoken:
Dre, just let it run.
Hey yo, turn the beat up a little bit
Hey yo, this song is for anyone... fuck it, just shut up and listen
Hey yo

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences gettin' this stress
That's been eatin' me recently off of this chest

And I rest again peacefully (peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter

To not come and speak to me (speak to me)
I don't know you and no, I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-ing thing
I'm not Mr. *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick

If you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet (10 feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you

Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of arguin' (of arguin)
I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be, it's just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content.
That song ""Guilty Conscience"" has gotten such rotten responses.""

And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinky

Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school

And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see an upper class city

Havin' this happenin' (this happenin' )
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name Is""

And pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
That copped me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)
To deal with these cocky caucasians

Who think, I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?

The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
Till I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (ahhh)
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (me crazy)
I can't take it, I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am

And I was gonna lay it down for you
 
I tried to focus my attention
But I feel so A-D-D
I need some help, some inspiration
But it's not coming easily

(Whoa) Tryin' to write a classic

There's no other way to better say
I love you, I love you
 
Read some Byron, Shelley, and Keates
Recited it over a hip-hop beat
I'm havin' trouble sayin' what I mean
With dead poets and a drum machine
 
You know I had some studio time booked
But I couldn't find the killer hook
Now you're gonna raise the bar right up
Nothin' I write is ever good enough

And too high to see below 
Just hangin' on your daily dose 

I know you never needed anyone 
But the rolling papers for your grass 
How can you give what you don't have 

You keep on aiming for the top 
And quit before you sweat a drop 
Feed your empty brain 
With your hydroponic pot 
Start out playing with yourself 
You get more fun within your shell 
Nice to meet you but I gotta go my way 

I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain 
But you're so in love with yourself 
If I say my heart is sore 
Sounds like a cheap metaphor 
So I won't repeat it no more 

I rather eat my soup with a fork 
Or drive a cab in New York 
'Cause to talk to you is harder work 

So what's the point of wasting all my words 
If it's just the same or even worse 
Than reading poems to a horse 

You keep on aiming for the top 
And quit before you sweat a drop 
Feed your empty brain 
With your hydroponic pot 
I bet you'll find someone like you 
'Cause there's a foot for every shoe 
And I wish you luck but I've other things to do 

I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain 
But you're so in love with yourself 
If I say my heart is sore 
Sounds like a cheap metaphor 
So I won't repeat it no more 

I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain

They throw me high fives
She says the Bible is all that she reads
And prefers that I not use profanity
Your mouth was so dirty

Life of the party and she swears that she's artsy
But you could distinguish Miles from Coltrane

So flawless

And poses for pictures that aren't being taken

'Cause I won't stop holding on

This is an emergency
So are you listening?
And I can't pretend that I don't see this

'Cause I've seen love die way too many times
When it deserved to be alive (when it deserved to be alive)
And I've seen you cry way too many times
When you deserved to be alive, alive

Yo, the saga begins, beget war
I draw first blood be the first to set it off
My cause, tap all jaws lay down laws
We takin' what's yours we do jerks rush the doors
Here come the deez tryin' to make breeze and guns toss
In full force, my team'll go at your main source
We're not tourists, hit bosses and take hostage
Your whole setup, from the ground up we lock shit
Blood flood your eye, fuck up your optics
Switch to killer instincts for niggaz pop shit
Yo nigga Noyd what's the topic? Nine pound we rocked in
Ninety-six strike back with more hot shit
Illuminate my team'll glow like, radiation
With no time for patient, or complication
Let's get it done right, my click airtight
Trapped in a never ending gunfight so niggaz lose stripes
Or lose life, jail niggaz sendin kites to the street
Over some beef that wasn't fully cooked, finish 'em off
Well done meat, that said twenty-two slug to your head
Travel all the way down to your leg

Chorus: together

Aiyyo it's hell on earth, whose next or gonna be first
The projects is front lines, and the enemy is one time
I ain't gotta tell you
It's right in front of your eyes
(Repeat 2X)

We wreck the QBC, nigga rep yours it's all love
Milli stacked down, heavenly guarded by hollow tip slug
Then crack down, on wannabe thugs adapt to gat sound
And bow down, slow the fuck up, see how my foul now
Articulate, hittin body parts to start shiftin shit
Never hesitant, it's the crack game unlimited
Summon rasta we can do this, forever infinite
Then reminesce, twenty years later how we was gettin' it
Either with me go against the grain you better hit me
Leggin me or robbin me niggaz better body me
'Cause it's a small world and niggaz, talkin' like bitches
Bitches singin' like snitches, pointin you out in pictures
'Cause she rep the QBC faithfully, playa hatin' me
All that bullshit, is just makin' me
More the better, then concentrate on gettin' chedda
If shorty set you up you better dead her, I told you
Shape and mold you, Sun you, then I hold you
Like a pimp mind control you double edge blow you
It'll be I, like I'm supposed to, the click is coastal
International to local, Bacardi mix physically fix
Hit you with shit, that'll leave a loose nigga stiff
Probably thick, Son I solved em
Pulled him in my world then evolved him to chaos
Walk the beat like, around the way cops the average pitstop
QBCity GodFather Part III, Gotti Gambino
And Ty Nitty, Scarface rest in peace

Yo, the heavy metal king hold big shit, with spare clips
You seein clips when the mac spit your top got split
Layin dead with open eyes close his eyelids
Turn off his lights switch to darkness, cause deep in the abyss
Is street life, blood on my kicks, shit on my knife
Youse the wild child, kid cold turnin' men into mice
I was born to take power leave my mark on this planet
The Phantom of Crime Rap, niggaz is left stranded
Shut down your operation, closed for business
Leave a foul taste in your mouth, like Guinness
POW niggaz is found MIA
We move like the special forces, green beret
Heavily around my throat, I don't play
Shit brand new, back in eighty-nine, the same way
The God P walk with a limp see, but simply
To simplify shit, no man can go against me
Test me you must be bent G, don't tempt me
I had this full clip for so long, it needs to empty
The reason why it full for so long, 'cause I don't waste shit
You probably hid, blood in your mouth, so you could taste it
Quiet as kept, I lay back and watch the world spin
I hear thugs, claimin that they gonna rob the Mobb
When they see us, I tell you what black, here's the issue
It's a package deal, you rob me, you take this message
Along with that, I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm tryin' to make CREAM and that's that
Whatever it takes however it gots to go down
Four mikes on stage a motherfuckin four pound
Speakers leakin out sound and niggaz leakin on the ground
I could truly care less the God will get his
Regardless blow for blow let's find out who wear hardest
This rap artist used to be a stickup artist
Sometimes I test myself see if I still got it
A live nigga stay on point never diss
Regard shit or forget the essence, from which I emerged
P is sick, so save that bullshit for the burbs

Turned a whiter shade of pale

She said there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might just as well've been closed

Walked outta hell's kitchen
Why bother cherishin'
My past is everything, wrong, and my arrogance
Walk down the stairs pissin'
Cop us 'cause they're bitchin'
Life isn't fair, singin'
Blues and my rap drippin'
Ooze out the blood sinkin
Deep down to earth thinking
Leave out a nerp chicken
I should run, forfeit, and everything I know listen!

I was the misdirected
I was the least expected
Hop on and get rejected
Walk on and feel neglected
I feel like I'm the message
Unheard but I'm the message
I'm the last prolific remaining offer from the gutter

Shot was my girlfriend
When we was younger
Her I was scarred yo
Bullets I survived though
Death it's came easy
Truth the games needs me
Never let them see me down, smile while I'm bleeding

Smile when your struggling
Smile when you're in jail
Smile when your dead broke
Smile and the rents due
Smile you ain't got friends now
Smile and no one knows you
Never let them see you down smile while you bleeding
Smile when he leaves you
Smile cause girl he needs you
Smile plenty single mothers cry the tears you do
Smile despite the war
Smile despite the pain yo
Never let them see you down smile while you bleeding

To my man Kareem in prison
I can't speak your name
It hurt me that you never listened
It can't be the same
I had to grow my intuition
Had me deep in pain
'Cause I knew my options were either broke or the prison chains
I can't do it
I can't see it, look
Dammit, I can't blow it
I got a judge telling me my life's key
They will throw it
No sir
I plan to have a chauffeur
It seems to me this chopping crack is really going no where

Therefore
I'm resurrected

The poor injection
I infect you with the real
The dustyfeetphilosahectagos
I spit, so sick
I skid out
I'm fallin'
I'm shit outta luck and I'm trapped but I'll get out

Can you help me
I'm going crazy
My mom plays trix and I beat on the floor like bush wick
My fists bloody and blistered
A pair like I'm ballistic
I just stare at the red and smile while I'm bleeding

There are a few things you gotta take into account
I'm not an entertainer I've never been a clown
I was born where the mothers give birth while they frown
I would walk with the kids that would bra sound ah
Never really thought I'd make it to fourteen
And anybody wanted to fight I was most keen
Plus I had a little temper it was often foreseen
Yo say something bout my momma id shoot ya dead out clean
But ya gotta keep in mind that I grew up Mogadishu (tell em)
The only law was gun law
And we don't walk with a pistol
You get laughed at for being so insensitive to the environment
Cause how will you be heard when those big boys are firin'
War is no place for a child
Especially if hes rollin' with an ak and a smile
He had witnesses on mother bloody in a towel
But please, please, please, please

Hey yo, its hell on earth down here the pavement scorching
Its more on roc when the Mobb walks in
Shit gets hot like a ill pot of grits spilled on you
Spit fire with nines but never squealed on you

I understood you should try to take my life
If I was you I would too damn right
If I had drama with a nigga like such as myself
I couldn't even sleep at night until...
I made things right
Pull out guns exchange a fight
Be the first to let off mines ignite the pipes...
And never let the daylight deceive
During the suns' hours niggaz do bleed
Aim for the waist and something on the top gets shot
Niggaz can't shoot never made a thing drop
Keep cream of the crop
Fresh out of box shit filled to the top
Smell the barrell when its bolt-locked nigga

But I ain't crying no more about how you're gone
Used to hold me down niggaz front its on

Risky on point hope these cats is getting the point whisper out my name
Stand but please don't point call me paranoid

And there's not much I want to know
'Cause your pretty face will do just fine
You'll be the star
Of my very last show
Let's go for a long ride
I'll show you places you won't ever want to leave

In broken alleys, in the back of every street

Dancing to the beat, but they'll never see this corpse

There's a rumbling in the skies
I've been wading through the high muddy water
With the heat rising in my eyes

Every day your memory grows dimmer
It doesn't haunt me like it did before
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

When I was in Missouri
They would not let me be
I had to leave there in a hurry
I only saw what they let me see

You broke a heart that loved you
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
I've been walking that lonesome valley
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

People on the platforms
Waiting for the trains
I can hear their hearts a-beatin'
Like pendulums swinging on chains

When you think that you've lost everything
You find out you can always lose a little more
I'm just going down the road feeling bad
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

I'm going down the river
Down to New Orleans
They tell me everything is gonna be all right
But I don't know what ""all right"" even means

I was riding in a buggy with Miss Mary Jane
Miss Mary Jane got a house in Baltimore
I been all around the world, boys
Now I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

Gotta sleep down in the parlor
And relive my dreams
I'll close my eyes and I wonder
If everything is as hollow as it seems

Some trains don't pull no gamblers
No midnight ramblers, like they did before
I been to Sugartown, I shook the sugar down

TRAWFGF128E0792FE0.h5,Extreme,Stop The World,"All the world's a masquerade
Made up of fools and philosophers
Were it to rain on our charade
All washes away, except for our true colors

If any people bothered looking for truth, please
(Stop the world from spinning 'round)
Instead we choose to follow footsteps of fools, please
(Stop the world from spinning 'round)

If nothing's new under the sun for me and you
Won't somebody please...

Stop the world
Stop the world
I wanna get off
Stop the world
Stop the world
I wanna get off

If we forget yesterday
We're bound to repeat it tomorrow
It's not too late to start today
Better off safe than sorry

Do unto those as you would do to yourselves, please
(Stop the world from spinning 'round)
We need more feet to walk in one another's shoes, please
(Stop the world from spinning 'round)

There's nothing new under the sun for me and you,
Won't somebody please...

Stop the world
Stop the world
I wanna get off
Stop the world
Stop the world
Where there is love
Where there is love

Stop!...the world
Stop the world
I wanna get off
Stop the world
Stop the world
I wanna get off

You gotta stop...
You gotta stop it
You gotta stop...

Stop the world
Stop the world
I wanna get off
Stop the world
Stop the world
Where there is love

Ah... Stop the world
Stop the world... ooh
