 From a Jack to a King
From loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an Ace and I won a Queen
And walked away with your heart

From a Jack to a King
With no regret I stacked the cards last night
And lady luck played her hand just right
To make me King of your heart
For just a little while
I thought that I might lose the game
Then just in time
I saw the twinkle in your eye

From a Jack to a King
From loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an Ace and I won a Queen
You made me King of your heart

For just a little while
I thought that I might lose the game
Then just in time
I saw the twinkle in your eye
From a Jack to a King
From loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an Ace and I won a Queen
You made me King of your heart I know something about love. You've gotta want it bad
If that guy's got into your blood, go out and get him
If you want him to be the very part of you
That makes you want to breathe, here's the thing to do

Tell him that you're never gonna leave him
Tell him that you're always gonna love him
Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him right now

I know something about love. You gotta show it and make him
See the moon up above. Reach out and get it
If you want him to make your heart sing out
And if you want him to only think of you

Ever since the world began it's been that way
For man and woman were created to make love their destiny
Then why should true love be so complicated? Oh

I know something about love. You gotta take it and
Show him what the world is made of, one kiss will prove it
If you want him to be always by your side
Take his hand tonight and swallow your foolish pride and
Tell him that you're never gonna leave him
Tell him that you're always gonna love him ... Rescue me, or take me in your arms

Ooh! This is dedicated to the one I love...

While I'm far away from you, my baby,
I know it's hard for you, my baby,
Because it's hard for me, my baby,
And the darkest hour is just before dawn---

Each night before you go to bed, my baby,
Whisper a little prayer for me my baby.
And tell all the stars above
This is dedicated to the one I love...

"Life" can never be exactly like we want it to be.
I could be satisfied knowing you love me.
But there's one thing I want you to do especially for me---
And it's something that everybody needs.

Each night before you go to bed, my baby,
Whisper a little prayer for me, my baby,
And tell all the stars above---
This is dedicated to the one I love.
This is dedicated to the one I love
This is dedicated to the one I love... It's my party and I'll cry if I want to

Why was he holding her hand
When he's supposed to be mine?

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to

Till Johnny's dancing with me
I've got no reason to smile

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to

You would cry too, if it happened to you

Judy and Johnny just walked through the door
Like a queen with her king
Oh, what a birthday surprise
Judy's wearing his ring

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
You would cry too, if it happened to you

Oh, I ain't talkin' 'bout your old lady
Ow!
Oh yeah, this is Jimi talkin' to you
Yeah, baby Went to the fortune teller
To have my fortune read
I didn't know what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head 

Siad she'd take a look at my palm
She said "Son, you feel kinda warm"
And she looked into her crystal ball
Said "You're in love" 

Said it could not be so
Not with all the girls I know
She said when the next one arrives
Looking into her eyes 

I left there in a hurry
Looking forward to my big surprise
The next day I discovered
That the fortune teller told me a lie 

I hurried back down to that woman
As mad as I could be
I told her I didn't see nobody
Why'd she make a fool out of me 

Then something struck me
As if it came from up above
While looking at the fortune teller
I fell in love 

Now I'm a happy fellow
Well I'm married to the fortune teller
We're happy as we can be
Now I get my fortune told for free 

Now I'm a happy fellow
Well I'm married to the fortune teller
We're happy as we can be
And I get my fortune told for free Time is on my side, yes it is
Time is on my side, yes it is

Now you always say
That you want to be free
But you'll come running back (said you would baby)
You'll come running back (I said so many times before)
You'll come running back to me

Oh, time is on my side, yes it is
Time is on my side, yes it is

You're searching for good times
But just wait and see
You'll come running back (I won't have to worry no more)
You'll come running back (spend the rest of my life with you, baby)
You'll come running back to me

Go ahead, go ahead and light up the town
And baby, do everything your heart desires
Remember, I'll always be around
And I know, I know
Like I told you so many times before
You're gonna come back, baby
'Cause I know
You're gonna come back knocking
Yeah, knocking right on my door
Yes, yes

Well, time is on my side, yes it is
Time is on my side, yes it is

'Cause I got the real love
The kind that you need
You'll come running back (said you would, baby)
